# #666 Axis Of Chess

Welcome to "Axis of Chess", my little excuse for using up a bunch of spare Pit-Road 1:700 vehicles.

## Notes

I shamelessly borrowed the idea from
[@beckersmodels](https://www.instagram.com/beckersmodels/)
after seeing his brilliant
[armour chess in 1:100](https://www.instagram.com/p/Chbbw94r8Ze/).

1:700 scale turns out to be a nice size to do little base vignettes on S$0.10 coins.
It took quite a few weeks to make the pieces and a couple of modelling sessions to make the chess board.
The chess tiles are actually plywood decals from
[@proper.plane](https://www.instagram.com/proper.plane/); I was originally going to do two shades of wood tile, but I stopped at this midway point that I really like - gives the impression of a marble and wood hand-crafted board, though it's actually just plastic and decals;-)

### The Kit

I love these 1:700 vehicle sets from Pit-Road.
They give you a good selection of vehicles and are wonderfully moulded and detailed for 1:700.
At the moment the range is quite limited
but there are [more kits in development](https://pit-road.jp/plastic_afv_model_700/)
that will add US, Soviet and British subjects to the line.

At present though I could only get axis forces, hence the red-on-red action!

### Build Log

The Pit-Road 1:700 military vehicles are both incredibly small and also incredibly detailed

![build01a](./assets/build01a.jpg?raw=true)
![build01b](./assets/build01b.jpg?raw=true)

A bunch of 5c (S$) coins and primed models from the Pit-Road kits - perfect together.

Afrika Corp ready for action

The only problem with the Pit-Road kits is that they are limited to axis forces, hence the red-on-red action!

Making a chess board - some plasticard and bass wood.

The magic starts to happen with plywood decals
