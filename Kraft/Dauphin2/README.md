## Notes

The [Eurocopter (now Airbus Helicopters) AS365 Dauphin  (Dolphin)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurocopter_AS365_Dauphin),
formerly known as the Aérospatiale SA 365 Dauphin 2, is a medium-weight multipurpose twin-engine helicopter produced by Airbus Helicopters.

It has been produced in many civilian and military variants.

### Paint Scheme

It was the schemes that lured me into buying this kit:

* [Registration JA6740](https://flyteam.jp/registration/JA6740) - 横浜市消防航空隊 Yokohama City Firefighting Air Corps
* [Registration JA119A](https://flyteam.jp/registration/JA119A) - 東京消防庁航空隊 Tokyo Fire Department Air Corps
* [Registration JA9980](https://flyteam.jp/registration/JA9980) - 東京消防庁航空隊 Tokyo Fire Department Air Corps
* [Registration JA9648](https://flyteam.jp/registration/JA9648) - 警視庁 Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department

I chose to do JA9648, as pictured on the box cover.

### Build Log

The cockpit is not particularly detailed and I didn't do anything other than find a dashboard decal that I could add.

TBH, by the time I got around to building it, the scheme was not enough to get me fired up.
So this, unfortunately, is one of those builds I just powered thru in order to get it off the bench.
(I bought the kit early in my return to the hobby - before I figured out that 1:48 is not really my thing, especially for helicopters, and that I'm interested in more than building a machine for the machine's sake)

Nevertheless, I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. But now it may just go in the bin instead of taking up space in my limited display/storage area!
