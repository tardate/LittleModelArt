## Notes

The Stridsvagn 103 (Strv 103) is a Swedish main battle tank used between 1967 and 1997.

It was the first main battle tank to use a gas turbine engine, but it is mainly distinguished by the lack of a turret for the main gun.
 The result was a very low-profile design with an emphasis on survivability and heightened crew protection level.
 It was replaced by the Leopard 2 variants Stridsvagn 121 and Stridsvagn 122.

While turret-less armoured fighting vehicles are usually classified as assault guns or tank destroyers,
the Strv 103 is considered a tank since that matched its designated combat role.
