## Notes

I've never been particularly interested in armor as a modelling subject per se,
I have been mesmerized by the quality and range of techniques used these days for weathering and featuring armor in dioramas.

So when I won the Airfix M7 Priest kit in a contest last year, I got this idea of featuring it as a an abandoned and derelict wreck,
with a young boy scrambling over it while his sister looks on. And we see the father approach and bark a stern
"Get down right now. That is not a toy, my boy!"

This is how far I've got so far...

### Airfix M7 Priest Kit

#### Schemes

the kit has decals and paint callouts for two schemes :

* A - Howitzer Motor Carriage M7 Priest C Battery, 78th Field Artillery Battalion, 2nd Armoured Division, US 7th Army, Germany 1945.
* B - Howitzer Motor Carriage M7 Priest A Troop, 22nd Battery, 24th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, Italy 1944.

I'm going with the Royal Artillery.

### Figures

I spent a while trying to find suitable figures. I eventually settled on a set from Master Box:
[Civilians Western Region, WWII era MB3567](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/master-box-mb3567-civilians--133854)

I'm using three of the figures from the kit.

First pass painting these 1:35 MasterBox figures. Still trying to knock another few years off the "child", but pretty happy how they are turning out
