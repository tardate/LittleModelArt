## Notes

The [Polikarpov I-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polikarpov_I-16) was the world's first low-wing cantilever monoplane fighter with retractable landing gear.

At the start of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, Republican forces (the good guys) pleaded for fighter aircraft
and ultimately 475 I-16 Type 5s and Type 6s served in the
[Spanish Republican Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Republican_Air_Force).

The
[Clear Prop! Polikarpov I-16 Type 5 No. CP72023 1:72](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/clear-prop-cp72023-polikarpov-i-16-type-5--1397963)
is a beautiful little kit. Here I've modified it for an inflight display on my wall.

### Build Log

![build01a](./assets/build01a.jpg?raw=true)

Fighting fascists in the skies of Spain! 21 Air Group, 4 Escuadrilla de Mosca, 1937-1938.

This is really a beautifully designed @clearpropmodels I-16 Type 5 in 1:72, makes for a perfect weekend project.
In-flight conversion was quite easy with just the kit parts slightly sanded for fit.

ClearProp are a Ukrainian manufacturer that covers a range of classic and more obscure subjects.
I first became really aware of them when I saw Brett Green's H72N Hawk build in Models for Ukraine Vol 1 published by @chris.meddings,
and since then I've been gradually working through their catalogue;-)
