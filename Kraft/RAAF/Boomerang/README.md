## Notes

The CAC CA-19 Boomerang ‘Jungle Scouts’ is another interesting kit from Special Hobby depicting equipment used by Australian forces in the Second World War.

The [CAC Boomerang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAC_Boomerang) was the first Australian-built fighter aeroplane to see the action in the Second World War. Boomerangs were operated in the defence of Australia and also fought over New Guinea and other Pacific islands. Its final version was the fighter-reconnaissance CA-19 which was equipped with a downward looking camera aft of the pilot's cockpit.

### Paint Scheme

Chosen scheme: A46-217, QE-G, named "Hep Cat", pilot Fl/L L. Burghard, No 4 Sqn RAAF Cape Hoskins, New Britain, February 1945.
The cat possibly refers to the Geelong Football Club.

### Build Log

Always a good day to start a new project, and always something interesting from Special Hobby, even if the instructions can be a bit like "part fits through here, under this other part, and attached in this general area, sorry no locator marks or lugs"

![build01a](./assets/build01a.jpg?raw=true)

Cockpit done.. that's about half the model!

![build01b](./assets/build01b.jpg?raw=true)

The kit comes with resin emgine parts that are nicely detailed.

![build01c](./assets/build01c.jpg?raw=true)

As I've found to be quite common with Special Hobby kits, the cockpit assembly lacks positive locating guides and has some fit issues.
But I managed to squeeze it all in with a bit of effort.

![build01d](./assets/build01d.jpg?raw=true)

Curious that the propeller doesn't have a freely rotating shaft. So it just got permanently glued on.

![build01e](./assets/build01e.jpg?raw=true)

An that's it for the build with aerial rigged. I had some real issues getting the decal carrier film to blend. Not silvering per se, just very obvious tonal difference especially with all the little stencils. Rather than wast time trying to clean them all up,
I think I would have preferred to just skip all the stencil marks just apply the main insignia.

The is the CA-19 Boomerang with a CA-3 Wirraway in the background (both Special Hobby 1:72 kits)

![build02b](./assets/build02b.jpg?raw=true)

The Hep Cat nose art was apparently a very stylish nod to the Cats - the Geelong Footy Club.
