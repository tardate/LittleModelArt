Building the Special Hobby 1:72 CAC Wirraway, as stationed at Seletar in 1941 - just up the road from me (no electronics).

## Notes

I picked up the
[CAC CA-3/5 Wirraway "First Blood over Rabaul" Special Hobby No. SH72331 1:72](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/special-hobby-sh72331-cac-ca-3-5-wirraway--966331) kit on special.

Not only is it an interesting Australian adaptation of the North American NA-16,
but it was stationed just near me at Seletar in 1941.

The kit is the first I've tried from Special Hobby. I've heared mixed reactions, especially for "short run" kits.
Overall I enjoyed the build, with a few minor issues:

* no part numbers on the sprue (must cross-check with the instructions). This appear spretty common for Special Hobby
* kit was not designed with much in the way of positive locator features, making fit a little difficult.
* cockpit details are a bit crude, doubt the accuracy.
