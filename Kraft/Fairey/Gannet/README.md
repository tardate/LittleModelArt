### The Build

I approached this as a quick out of the box build just for fun.
I even decided to take the armour modeller's approach - build it before painting.
It worked OK in this case!

There's not much cockpit detail in the two modules that fit neatly into the fuselage.

All stitched up and ready for painting. Attempting this "armour style" for a speedy build.
It seemed like I could manage to paint the cockpit after the fuselage was closed up.

![build01b](./assets/build01b.jpg?raw=true)

Basic painting complete. The main issue at this stage was the fit of the canopies.

My "light grey green" may be a bit on the spearmint chewing gum end of the spectrum;-)

Decals on and a clean finish for now.

It needed Jupiter-grade levels of Liquid Gravity not to be a tail-sitter!
