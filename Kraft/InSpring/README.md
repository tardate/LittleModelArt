# #678 In Spring

Perhaps my final build for 2022. Fittingly, figures from MasterBox of Ukraine, in a diorama that attempts to capture my greatest hope for what will come in the new year..

Title: "In spring.."

Perhaps my final build for 2022. Fittingly, figures from MasterBox of Ukraine, in a diorama that attempts to capture my greatest hope for what will come in the new year..

### The Kit

I'm using two figures from the
[Master Box Civilians Western Region, WWII era MB3567](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/master-box-mb3567-civilians--133854)
kit. The sculpting of the old man is very good.
The teenage girl not so well sculpted, but being one of a very small number of decent female civilian figures, I have seen her pop up in quite a few dioramas by other modellers!

### Build Log

High-density foam for the base. I suspect I was subliminally channelling Night Shift when I made the wall.

![build01a](./assets/build01a.jpg?raw=true)

Detritus of war came from the spare parts box

![build01b](./assets/build01b.jpg?raw=true)

Base colour and layout..

![build01c](./assets/build01c.jpg?raw=true)

![build01d](./assets/build01d.jpg?raw=true)

Laying down some grass, vines and gravel

![build01e](./assets/build01e.jpg?raw=true)

Adding paint and pastels for the ground colour

![build01f](./assets/build01f.jpg?raw=true)

Tree is copper wire frame and some dried flower stems for the finer detail.

![build01g](./assets/build01g.jpg?raw=true)

I realise I missed taking photos of the process of adding all the leaves (one by one with superglue)

![build01h](./assets/build01h.jpg?raw=true)

I like how the old man came out. Sorry, missed taking all the in-progress shots.

![build02a](./assets/build02a.jpg?raw=true)

![build02b](./assets/build02b.jpg?raw=true)

The "girl" seems to have distinctly "middle-aged" features which I tried to soften down. The hair replacement was a somewhat failed experiment: from a distance, seems OK, but totally out of scale close-up.

![build02c](./assets/build02c.jpg?raw=true)

Compositing the figures with the base and adding leaf scatter

![build02d](./assets/build02d.jpg?raw=true)

"In spring.." final composite?

![build03a](./assets/build03a.jpg?raw=true)

![build03b](./assets/build03b.jpg?raw=true)

The broom is actually a rake from the MB kit with bristles added.

![build03c](./assets/build03c.jpg?raw=true)

![build03d](./assets/build03d.jpg?raw=true)

![build03e](./assets/build03e.jpg?raw=true)

![build03f](./assets/build03f.jpg?raw=true)

![build03g](./assets/build03g.jpg?raw=true)

![build03h](./assets/build03h.jpg?raw=true)
