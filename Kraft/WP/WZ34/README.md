## Notes

The
[Samochód pancerny wz. 34](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoch%C3%B3d_pancerny_wz._34)
was the basic armoured car of Polish Army at the outbreak of World War II in 1939, despite it already being obsolete.

### The Kit

I picked up the [Mirage Hobby No. 355020 1:35](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/mirage-hobby-355020-wersja-wz-34-ii--1020935)
kit in a bag for $5 at a charity sale.

### Paint Scheme

In 1936-1937 there was a standard camouflage scheme introduced for Polish vehicles:

* irregular patches of greyish sand and dark brown (sepia) over base color of brown-green.
* airbrushed, with soft transitions, their shapes were mainly horizontal. No standard pattern

An older scheme was used between 1932 and 1936 aka "Japanese camouflage":

* patches in bright yellowish sand, dark green and dark brown, separated with thin black stripes
* recent publications suggest that the colours might have been yellowish sand, olive green and light blue-gray

It was the bizarre "Japanese camouflage" scheme that initially caught my eye, so I'm going with that, using the following colours:

| Feature              | Color                   | Recommended | Paint Used |
|----------------------|-------------------------|-------------|------------|
| camo                 | Sand Yellow             | 70.916      | Hunbrol 110 + 70.917 Beige |
| camo                 | Olive Grey              | 70.888      | 70.893 US Dark Green |
| camo                 | Beige Brown             | 70.875      | 70.981 Orange Brown + 70.846 Mahogany Brown |
| camo                 | German Grey             | 70.995      |  |
| tires                | Black Grey              | 70.862      | 70.862 |
| gun barrel           |                         | 70.073      |  |
| tool handles         | Refractive Green        | 70.890      |  |

## Build Log

It is quite a basic kit and some of the detail is a little soft, but a nice quick build.

![build01a](./assets/build01a.jpg?raw=true)

How could I not chose the so-called "Japanese camouflage" scheme, used between 1932 and 1936.
i.e. the interwar period when apparently someone lost the memo on what camouflage was for!!

![build02a](./assets/build02a.jpg?raw=true)

I selected two figures from the MiniArt Polish Tank Crew set for a little diorama

So as I was finish this up just before Christmas, I couldn't help myself and went with a light-hearted, festive variation...
