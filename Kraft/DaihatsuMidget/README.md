## Notes

The [Daihatsu Midget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daihatsu_Midget) was introduced in 1957
and it is fair to say it became one of the most iconic vehicles in [Daihatsu history](https://www.daihatsu.com/company/history/E_history110/).
In total there were [317152 units](http://route0030.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-147.html) produced

### The Kit

### Paint Scheme

To the extent I kept track of this...

| Feature         | Color    | Recommended | Paint Used |
|-----------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| upper           | beige    | | 70.917 Beige |
| lower           | green    | | 70.885 Pastel Green |
| seat            | brown    | | 70.846 Mahogany Brown + 70.889 Olive Brown 4:1 |

### Build Log

The kit itself is quite basic but a lot of fun for just ¥750.

I decided to discard the hard roof from the kit and refine the frame and tray. Later I'll add "vinyl roof" like the original Daihatsu Midget DMK from 1957.

Using the classic pastel green and beige colour scheme.

Discovering for myself just how amazing a Molotow Liquid Chrome pen is

The build so far... I'm still working on a vinyl cab cover to replace the hard shell from the kit, and I'd like to put this in a diorama or at least a street scene from Tokyo in the 50s.

#### Adding a Custom Tarp

How it's going - very happy with the tarp. Now back on the shelf and I'll call this complete for the time being while I contemplate and collect ideas for a diorama.
