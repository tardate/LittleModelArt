## Notes

The T-34 is one of the most iconic tanks of World War II, famously deployed with the Red Army on the Eastern Front / [Great Patriotic War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Patriotic_War_(term))

T-34 Model 1942 was equiped with a 76.2 mm F-34 main gun. It is common referred to as the T-34/76 however this was not offical designation.

## Kit

I picked up the kit at a very good price:

## Build

this is a fun little kit - simple build but nicely detailed

![build01a](./assets/build01a.jpg?raw=true)

simple black primer

![build01b](./assets/build01b.jpg?raw=true)

I've popped the hatches (simple kit mod) and selected two of the CMK figures to crew it

![build02a](./assets/build02a.jpg?raw=true)

rubber tracks are the only option in the kit, and they take a bit of wrangling to finish well

![build02b](./assets/build02b.jpg?raw=true)

hmm, figure painting in progress. Doing this with acrylics and my blends are not going so well!

![build03a](./assets/build03a.jpg?raw=true)

The base color is Vallejo 70.897 Bronce Green. But I've mixed it quite a bit and layed pastel pigments later in the process.

 considering the next weathering steps...

![build04a](./assets/build04a.jpg?raw=true)

first round of pastels/pigments and oils..

![build05b](./assets/build05b.jpg?raw=true)

some more OPR

![build05a](./assets/build05a.jpg?raw=true)
![build05c](./assets/build05c.jpg?raw=true)

![build06a](./assets/build06a.jpg?raw=true)
![build06b](./assets/build06b.jpg?raw=true)

taking stock.. think I'll leave this for a few days then take a fresh look at the finish so far
