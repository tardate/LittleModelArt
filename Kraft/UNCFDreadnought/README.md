## Notes

I picked up the
[Star Blazers 2202 Mecha Colle No.11 U.N.C.F. Dreadnought Class Set 2 Bandai Spirits No. 5056766](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/bandai-spirits-5056766-uncf-dreadnought-class-set-2--1200206)
at a charity sale in 2022. Best $10 spent in a long time!

The
[United Nations Cosmo Force (UNCF)](https://yamato.fandom.com/wiki/United_Nations_Cosmo_Force)
[Dreadnought-class battleships](https://yamato.fandom.com/wiki/Dreadnought-class_battleship)
are from the
[Space Battleship Yamato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Battleship_Yamato)
anime series.

### Circuit Design

A 5v USB power connector is used to light a set of LED effects:

* 3mm blue LED inserted in the "Wave Motion Engine" of battleship YF
* pair of red 0805 LEDs in the "Wave Motion Gun" of battleship YF
* white 5050 LED with fibre optics are wired up to the portholes in the main superstructure of battleship YF
* pair of yellow 0805 LEDs in the "Wave Motion Gun" of battleship M22
* a series of yellow 5050 LEDs in the explosive cloud following battleship M22

### Build Log

Honestly, this kinda fell together all by itself as I was sorting new additions to the stash. Initial press-fit just to test the assembly.

![build01a](./assets/build01a.jpg?raw=true)

A pair of red 0805 LEDs go in the "Wave Motion Gun"

![build02a](./assets/build02a.jpg?raw=true)

3mm LED inserted in the "Wave Motion Engine"

![build02b](./assets/build02b.jpg?raw=true)

5050 LED with fibre optics are wired up to the portholes in the main superstructure.

![build02c](./assets/build02c.jpg?raw=true)

A pair of yellow 0805 LEDs go in the forward "Wave Motion Gun" of the other Dreadnought

![build02d](./assets/build02d.jpg?raw=true)

Attaching some 0.9mm copper wire with epoxy for posing the ships.

![build03a](./assets/build03a.jpg?raw=true)

Primed with Mr Hobby Aqueous Black Surfacer 1000
