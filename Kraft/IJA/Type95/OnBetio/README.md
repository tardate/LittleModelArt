## Notes

The [Battle of Tarawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tarawa)
was fought on 20–23 November 1943 between the United States and Japan at the Tarawa Atoll in the Gilbert Islands, and was part of Operation Galvanic, the U.S. invasion of the Gilberts (now known as the [Republic of Kiribati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiribati)).

The Battle of Tarawa was the first American offensive of the Pacific Island-hopping campaign.
It was also the first time in the Pacific War that the US faced serious Japanese opposition to an amphibious landing.
The battle mostly took place on and around the small island of Betio, the main island in the extreme southwest of Tarawa Atoll.

The garrison was made up of forces of the Imperial Japanese Navy, with 14 Type 95 light tanks under the command of Ensign Ohtani.

The battle didn't go as planned by either side, and loses were extremely high on both sides. The US ultimately prevailed,
with close to 100% casualties and loses.

This is hauntingly capture in a famous photo of an abandoned Type 95 Ha-Go light tank near bunker on Betio Island.
This is the inspiration for this diorama.

### Finally Gallery Shots

Aftermath: a Type 95 Ha-Gō (九五式軽戦車 ハ号) light tank sits destroyed amongst the devastation wrought on Betio.

Forces of the Imperial Japanese Navy garrisoned Tarawa Atoll in the Gilbert Islands, including 14 Type 95 light tanks. The American offensive from 20 November 1943 was the first amphibious landing to face serious Japanese opposition, with massive casualties for both sides. It marked the start of the Pacific Island-hopping campaign.

The diorama features the 1:72 IBG Models kit of the Type 95, and is inspired by a famous photograph from the battle.

I tried to go quite monochrome/sepia for the actual painting, and experimented quite a bit with ways of making palm fronds in this scale. Not quite there, but happy enough with the result to call it a successful try!
