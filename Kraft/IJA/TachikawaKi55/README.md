## Notes

The [Tachikawa Ki-55](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachikawa_Ki-55) 'Ida' was put into production in 1939 as the
Tachikawa Army Type 99 Advanced Trainer (キ55九九式高等练习机 - Ki-55 Type 99 Advanced Trainer).
By the time production ended in December 1943, 1078 had been built by Tachikawa and 311 by Kawasaki

### The Kit

This was a $5 bargain basement find at the 2022 Kits for Kids charity event.
Just a bag of parts, and a yellowed set of instructions and decals.

It is a
[Fujimi kit tooled in 1983](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/fujimi-7a-a1-tachikawa-ki-55--172648).

The decals were pretty ancient and I wasn't sure if they would be usable. Turns out the answer was "just".

| Feature         | Color                | Recommended | Paint Used |

### The Build

There's not much cockpit detail, but I was surprised how easily the dashboard pops with just a little paint.

Assembly is straight-forward and fit is much better than I would expect from a kit of this age.

![build01b](./assets/build01b.jpg?raw=true)

A nice weekender;-)

![build01c](./assets/build01c.jpg?raw=true)

I was prepared to have to mask/paint the relatively simple markings, but the original kits decals just managed to do the trick.

The final gallery shots - no special finishing or base for this one (yet).
