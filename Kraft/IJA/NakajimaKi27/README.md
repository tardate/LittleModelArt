## Notes

The Nakajima Ki-27 (九七式戦闘機 Type 97 Fighter) was the main fighter aircraft used by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service from 1937 to 1940. Its Allied nickname was "Nate".

Ki-27a had excellent maneuverability and was serious enemy for Soviet-built I-15bis and I-16 fighters in air battles over China and Mongolia in 1938-1939.

The Nakajima Ki-27 九七式戦闘機 was the main IJA fighter from 1937 to 1940, quite evenly matched with Soviet-built I-15bis and I-16 fighters in air battles over China and Mongolia in 1938-1939.

This is the ICM kit of the Ki-27a in 1:72 (ICM 72201). This is one of ICM's earlier releases, but the kit is still a pleasure to build - fits reasonably well, and details are good for the scale. It was a great kit to squeeze in as a refresher between more challenging/involved builds.

ICM is one of the leading kit companies from Ukraine. Valeriia Buzina from ICM told their story in Episode 13 of the Models From Ukraine podcast hosted by @chris.meddings,
and their diverse catalog is well represented in Models for Ukraine Vol 1 and 2: including my favourite build by Matt McDougal of the ICM OV-10A Bronco (check the grungy rocket pods!)
