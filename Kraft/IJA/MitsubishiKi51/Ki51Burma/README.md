## Notes

The [Mitsubishi Ki-51](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_Ki-51)
was introduced in 1939 and initially used in China. It was soon outclassed however by fighter aircraft of the other Allied powers.
However it did find a useful ground-attack role in the China-Burma-India theater, where it was able to operate from airfields too rough for many other aircraft.

The scheme depicted here is apparently for the 27th Hikō Sentai 飛行戦隊 in Burma 1942, according to the ClearProp instructions.
I've yet to find much information about this flying squadron, except that they also played a role in the
[Malayan campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_order_of_battle_during_the_Malayan_campaign).

### Circuit Design

A very simple circuit - just a micro-motor powered by a CR2032 3V coin cell battery.

Ki-51 "Sonia" Type 99 Assault Plane 九九式襲撃機, キ51 over Burma '42.
The workbench has been a little slow of late, but this great little 1:144 kit from @clearpropmodels has me inspired again!
Found just enough space inside to hide the smallest motor I had on hand.
