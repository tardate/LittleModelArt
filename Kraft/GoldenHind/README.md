## Notes

A nice diversion .. a
[mini metal model of the Golden Hind (Model 9209)](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Mini-Qute-Piece-Fun-3D-vehicle-Ford-cars-train-Titanic-ship-Black-Pearl-Metal-Puzzle-adult/32613478600.html)
ended up in my shopping cart on an impulse.

I've been curious about the recent popularity of these "3D metal models".
I am guessing the availability and affordability of precision laser cutting equipment might have something to do with it.

The "Metal Earth" brand is often seen in toy retailers
(it even has its [own sub reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/metalearth/)!),
but the model designs all see to be common from a few Chinese manufacturers.
The model I have here comes from [Shantou Mini Qute Trading Co. Ltd.](https://mqfun.en.alibaba.com/).

### Model Accuracy

The [Golden Hind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Hind) was an English galleon best known for her privateering circumnavigation of the globe between 1577 and 1580, captained by Sir Francis Drake.

There is only so much detail you can pack into a 20-piece model no more than 10cm long,
but I'm pretty impressed at the closeness of the model designer's approximation and the level of detail that has ben included.
