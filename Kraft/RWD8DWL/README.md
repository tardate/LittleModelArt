A simple build of the RWD-8 DWL Polish trainer 1:72 model 72502 from IBG Models (no electronics - yet).

## Notes

The RWD 8 was designed in response to a Polish Air Force requirement in 1931 for a basic trainer aircraft.
DWL (Doświadczalne Warsztaty Lotnicze) workshops produced aircraft for civilian use only.

I picked up this kit for a couple of reasons:

* as my first experience with a kit from the Polish model manufacturer [IBG models](http://www.ibgmodels.com/72502-2/) who specialize in a range of Polish subjects
* it's an interesting subject - strikes me as the kind of plane that Hergé would have loved to draw for a Tintin adventure (he didn't, AFAIK)
* my first attempt at painting a 1:72 scale plane with an airbrush

### The Kit

I purchased the kit direct from [IBG models](http://www.ibgmodels.com/72502-2/). Very reasonable pricing, including shipping (Poland to Singapore).

Sealed with with Mr Hobby Flat Matt Topcoat.

I didn't put any primer down first and learned to regret it - when removing masking tape for the "red swish" I managed to peel away big chunks of the base coat which hadn't adhered well to the plastic.

### Model Construction

The kit goes together very easily:

* parts fit well with virtually no flash
* quite simple - only 31 parts
* exterior surfaces are reasonably detailed, but detail in the cockpit is quite limited

The kit could probably do with some after-market detail.

The only addition I've made is tail control wires with [QW-Model Q04004 0.047mm rubber rigging](http://www.qw-model.com/nd.jsp?id=59#_np=111_356).

I subsequently found some suitable photoetch  - [PART S72086 1/72 RWD-8 Siedlce](http://en.ibg.com.pl/en,part-s72086-1-72-rwd-8-siedlce,3,82,84,86,2880.html#.YCPpiukzaL4) - that adds mainly cockpit detail I am missing. I might just have to build another RWD-8.. IBG have at least 4 variants to choose from!

## Final Thoughts

This is a great little plane that I'd never heard of before. It's very nicely rendered by IBG Models - excellent mould quality.
It's are very simple kit but also very cheap, which is nice.

The only real negative was the decals - I found the carrier material seems not to be completely transparent; I'm seeing distinct yellow tint (at least from some angles). I don't **think** that was my fault in application.

I'd like to try another kit from this company.
Perhaps one of their other 1/72 subjects e.g. [1/72 PZL.42](http://www.ibgmodels.com/72509-2/) that come with photo-etch,
or their more detailed 1/32 planes and 1/35 vehicles.
Or perhaps another RWD-8 from the 4 variants IBG have to choose from, along with [after-market PE](http://en.ibg.com.pl/en,part-s72086-1-72-rwd-8-siedlce,3,82,84,86,2880.html#.YCPpiukzaL4) to detail the cockpit.
