## Notes

I picked up this fairly old [Dragon 1:700 kit No. 7007](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/dragon-7007-hms-revenge-vs-soviet-victor-iii--1356080)
for SG$10 at a charity sale. I has full-hull models of HMS Revenge and also Soviet Victor III submarines and a couple of helicopters.

The models are pretty simplistic with not a lot of detail - but for my purposes fine. And they are submarines anyway - basically long tubes;-)

I'm just using the HMS Revenge in this build. It is basically a study of how to depict the classic image of a modern submarine cruising on the surface.

Insipration comes from shots such as this - HMS Revenge leaving Faslane:

### The Subject

[HMS Revenge (S27)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Revenge_(S27))
is a Resolution-class ballistic missile submarine that was operated by the Royal Navy from 1969 to 1992.

Resolution-class submarines were powered by a Vickers/Rolls-Royce PWR1 pressurised-water nuclear reactor
and armed with up to 16 UGM-27 Polaris A-3 nuclear missiles.

### Build Log

NB: No pictures of building and priming the sub as not much to see!

After building and priming the sub, I attacked a block of high-density foam with a DIY foam cutter to settle the sub in the water.

Used the standard foil, paper and mod-podge technique for creating the sea surface and wake.

Masked the sub for completing the water in-situ:

I built up the water with layers of gloss mod-podge and airbrushed colouring.

Wake was built up with cotton wool, touched up with Vallejo Model Color white.
Wash and wave tops are highlited with some [Deluxe Scenic Snow](https://deluxematerials.co.uk/collections/hobby/products/scenic-snow-kit)
