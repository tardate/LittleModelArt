### Southland Star transiting Cook Strait in a gale

This one is for my Dad: inspired by a picture he took from the top of the funnel on passage from Wellington to Christchurch NZ back in the 1970s. While he was busy taking photographs, the auxiliary boiler flashed up on an automatic cycle, blocking him with a screen of hot exhaust fumes from the funnel top access hatch. He got down eventually and (allegedly) vowed never be so stupid in the future.

## Build

I've wanted to build a model of one of the ships he served on for a long time, but commercial shipping is a very poorly served kit market. But that may have been a good thing, as it forced/allowed me to develop this experiment in "compressed perspective." 100% scratch except the figure, which is a putty mod of a 1:150 architectural figure. I guess it may even qualify as a "box diorama"?
