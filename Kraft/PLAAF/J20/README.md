## Notes

The [Chengdu J-20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengdu_J-20) (成都飞机工业集团的歼20) is the
third operational
[fifth-generation fighter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth-generation_fighter)
stealth fighter aircraft after the F-22 and F-35.

It is currently in service with the [People's Liberation Army Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Army_Air_Force)

### The Kit

Trumpeter have 5 different kits of the J-20 at the moment in 1:48, 1:72 and 1:144.
This is the 1:144 kit which is a cheap but fantastic buy - brilliant detail and a relatively easy build although in-flight conversion wasn't really anticipated by the kit.

### Build Log

The kit details are very good for the scale. In-flight conversion wasn't really anticipated by the kit, but not too difficult.

Cockpit details are just great:

![build01b](./assets/build01b.jpg?raw=true)

No 1:144 pilot figures on hand so I made a quick-and-dirty stand-in from spare sprue!

Behind the scenes with the in-flight base. Getting cotton wool to look like realistic clouds is tiring.

成都飞机工业集团的歼20 Caught in-flight, the "Mighty Dragon" Chengdu J-20..
this is the Trumpeter 1:144 kit - fantastic detail, though it took a bit of conversion to get it nicely wheels-up .. including a hand-carved pilot!
