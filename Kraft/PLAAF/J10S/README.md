Building the Trumpeter 1:72 Chengdu J-10S in early Ba Yi Aerobatics Team colours. No electronics in this one.

## Notes

The [Chengdu J-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengdu_J-10) also known as Vigorous Dragon (猛龙; Měnglóng)
is a single-engine, multirole fighter that was declared operational in 2003 after 18 years of development.

It is currently one of the main aircraft of the [PLAAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Army_Air_Force#Current_inventory)

NB: Binkov's Battlegrounds provided an interesting comparison of where the JF-17 and J-10 fit into China's domestic and export situation:

### August 1st or Ba Yi Aerobatics Team (Chinese: 八一飞行表演队)

The [Ba Yi (August 1st) Aerobatics Team 八一飞行表演队](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_1st_(aerobatic_team))
is the aerobatic demonstration team of the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF).
It was founded in 1962 and named after the date of founding of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), August 1, 1927.

The Aerobatics Team is notable for their female recuits.
Four of the team's first female pilots were
盛懿绯 (Sheng Yifei),
[余旭 (Yu Xu)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_Xu),
[陶佳莉 (Tao Jiali)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Jiali),
and 何晓莉 (He Xiaoli).
They joined the team on 15 December 2013.

In researching the subject I was really sad to discover that Yu Xu passed away in a 2016 fatal training accident in the J-10.

## The Kit

Trumpeter have a number of boxings of the Chengdu J-10 in 1:72 scale.
I picked up
[No. 01644](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/trumpeter-01644-j-10s-fighter--107127)
which includes a Ba Yi Aerobatics Team scheme

![kit-box](./assets/kit-box.jpg?raw=true)

As I wanted to display the craft in flight, I needed some pilot figures. These are not included in the kit.

I found some
[US Pilots with JHMCS helmet](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/pj-production-721142-us-pilots-with-jhmcs-helmet-seated-in-a-c--1313013)
from PJ Productions. Not exactly right, but close enough for a few easy modifications to give the right effect at this scale.

## Paint Scheme

It just took a bit of careful effort to measure and scale the paint scheme and make some patterns for masking.
I used 5 patterns, and just masked the fuselage stripes by eye.

![build01c](./assets/build01c.jpg?raw=true)

Main colours used:

| Colour       | Recommended | Used                         | Feature |
|--------------|-------------|------------------------------|---------|
| IJN Grey     | H61         | 70.989 Sky Grey                               | cockpit interior |
| Flat Black   | H12         | 70.950 Black                                  | cockpit seats |
| Khaki Green  | H80         | 70.924 Russian Unf. WWII                      | cockpit seats |
| White        | H1          | 70.951 White                                  | fuselage |
| Red          | H3          | 70.909 Vermillion + 70.956 Clear Orange (~3:1) | fuselage |
| Blue         | H5          | 70.963 Medium Blue                            | fuselage |


For the pilots I used 70.893 US Dark Green as the base colour for the flight suits and a bunch of other colours for detail.

The Aerobatics Team scheme as detailed for the Trumpeter kit appears to have been one of a few variants that
were seen in the early years of the J-10's life.

The
[Ba Yi (August 1st) Aerobatics Team 八一飞行表演队](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_1st_(aerobatic_team))
currently use J-10AY in a simpler and more angular red white and blue scheme.
NB: this scheme is depicted in
[Trumpeter's 1:48 kit No. 02857](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/trumpeter-02857-j-10ay-vigorous-dragon--142720)

## Construction Log

Starting with the cockpit as is traditional. Reasonably well detailed.

![build01a](./assets/build01a.jpg?raw=true)

Feels like I spent most of the weekend masking. Oh.. but surely worth the wait

![build01b](./assets/build01b.jpg?raw=true)

"Three dayz laitur.." masking challenge complete! Now on to finishing this striking display team livery (八一飞行表演队)

![build02a](./assets/build02a.jpg?raw=true)
![build02b](./assets/build02b.jpg?raw=true)
![build02c](./assets/build02c.jpg?raw=true)
![build02d](./assets/build02d.jpg?raw=true)

Done painting these nice 1:72 figures I found from PJ Productions to pilot my J-10S

![build03a](./assets/build03a.jpg?raw=true)

Ready for the aircrew...

![build04a](./assets/build04a.jpg?raw=true)

On the bench.. pretty much ready for first mounting test...

![build04b](./assets/build04b.jpg?raw=true)

![build04c](./assets/build04c.jpg?raw=true)

Happy campers..

![build04d](./assets/build04d.jpg?raw=true)
![build04e](./assets/build04e.jpg?raw=true)

A helping hand..

![build04f](./assets/build04f.jpg?raw=true)

Finally mounted and first shots of my Chengdu J-10S all dressed up to rock with the Bayi (August 1st) Aerobatics Team 八一飞行表演队. This is the Trumpeter 1:72 kit with pilot figures from PJ Productions.

Pictured in the background are four of the team's first female pilots 盛懿绯 (Sheng Yifei), 余旭 (Yu Xu), 陶佳莉 (Tao Jiali), and 何晓莉 (He Xiaoli).
They joined the team on Dec. 15, 2013.

In researching the subject I was really sad to learn that Yu Xu passed away in a 2016 fatal training accident in the J-10.
This directly inspired my choice of display, hopefully capturing the soaring spirit of flight, and making a fitting and humble tribute to these amazing women.

Trying again in daylight and after losing the acrylic protective sheet over the background - looking better now!
