## Notes

The
[JF-17 Thunder (جے ایف-17 گرج‎)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAC/PAC_JF-17_Thunder)
is a very light-weight multi-role fighter
jointly developed by the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex and the Chengdu Aircraft Corporation.
It has been in service with Pakistan since 2007,

It flew during the 2007 Pakistan Day Joint Services Parade sporting a striking livery, melding the Chinese and Pakistani flags.

It was designed to replace the A-5C, F-7P/PG, Mirage III, and Mirage V combat aircraft in the Pakistan Air Force (PAF).
Pakistan is still the major operator. Other operators include Myanmar, Nigeria with a number of other countries showing interest.

The Pakistani designation "JF-17" is short for "Joint Fighter-17", while it is designated "Fighter China-1 (FC-1) Fierce Dragon" by China.

## Construction

For a cheap & simple kit, the Trumpeter 1:72 FC-1/JF-17 is beautifully engineered with some nice cockpit detail

![build_01a](./assets/build_01a.jpg?raw=true)

FC-1/JF-17 cockpit test fit

![build_01b](./assets/build_01b.jpg?raw=true)

The striking promo scheme is what drew me to the FC-1/JF-17. Building up nicely. This is the shot before I attempt the insane decals!

![build_02](./assets/build_02.jpg?raw=true)

Basically complete...
