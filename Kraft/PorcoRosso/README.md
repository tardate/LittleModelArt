# #693 PorcoRosso

Revisiting one of my favourite films after so many years thanks to a wonderful 1:72 kit of the Porco Rosso Savoia S.21 from Fine Molds.

## Notes

[Porco Rosso](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104652/) is one of my favourite films of all time.

I discovered that Fine Molds have both a 1:72 and 1:48 model of Marco's Savoia S.21.

Here I'm building the
[Porco Rosso Savoia S.21 Idroplano da Caccia Sperimentale 1:72](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/finemolds-fj1-savoia-s21--157816)
with some customised motorization and base.

## Construction

The motor control circuit comprises:

* 555 timer-based PWM motor control
* push-button on switch with delayed automatic off

the water was many layers of paint and gloss mod podge to build up an effect with some sense of "depth"
