## Notes

Ukrainian Su-24M Fencer on an ultra low-level raid. Inspired by [Taras on TikTok!](https://www.tiktok.com/@miltokcover/video/7244108366513966342)

This is an amazing 1:144 kit from Armory Model Group of Ukraine, displayed with one of my favourite techniques for planes: picture frame in-flightüòéü™Å

I think my first introduction to Armory was picking my jaw off the floor looking at the Fairey Flycatcher build by Piotr S≈Åomi≈Ñski in Models for Ukraine Vol 1.
Taras Karabyn and Ilya Sobolev told the Armory story on Episode 3 of the Models From Ukraine podcast hosted by @chris.meddings

### Sukhoj Su-24M Fencer

[Sukhoi Su-24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhoi_Su-24) Fencer is a supersonic, all-weather tactical bomber developed in the Soviet Union,
entering full production in 1967.

The Ukrainian Air Force inherited all of its Su-24s from the Soviet Union in 1991.

Although an aging machine, Ukrainian Su-24s are possibly being used as launch platforms for the latest Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles.
