## Notes

The Jiefang CA-30 is a military truck widely used by the PLA, based on the Soviet ZIL-157.
It was produced between 1958 and 1986.
It was manufactured by FAW Jie Fang 一汽解放汽车有限公司, based in [Changchun, Jilin, China](https://goo.gl/maps/KqF9NMPK2o4Nn5do7).

I picked up a kit (1:72 scale) of the fuel truck variant from Trumpeter for a few reasons:

* as my first experience of a Trumpeter vehicle kit, to learn about the quality and features they offer
* practice spray painting
* investigate as a possible candidate for electrification and/or use in a diorama with a plane

## The Kit

The [Trumpeter Jie Fang CA-30 Fuel Truck 01104](http://www.trumpeter-china.com/index.php?g=home&m=product&a=show&id=2796&l=en)
is a simple 1:72 scale model. I purchased it from a [seller on aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32834495380.html)

The kit contains:

* 3 main sprues
* 1 clear sprue for window parts. Some clear acrylic stamped (it appears) as alternative windows (I did not use this)
* metal axles (allows the wheels to rotate in the final model)
* decals

## Model Construction

Construction is quite straight-forward. I left the cab, wheels and drive-train as separate components for painting.

Primed with Vallejo Surface Primer 70.601:

## Final Thoughts

On the kit:

* very happy with the end result (especially after painting)
* window parts are a bit thick and crude. I should have tested the fit before painting and final construction.
* windshield wipers are fragile parts
* glue behind the decals was a bit rough and overdone. Some decals required quite a soak to soften and remove the excess

Would/could I electrify this? Perhaps LED headlights and/or interior dome lighting. At this scale it is a bit small for RC conversion.
