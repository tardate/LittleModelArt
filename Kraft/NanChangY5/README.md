# #588 Nanchang Y-5

A simple build of the Antonov An-2 Colt/Nanchang Y-5 1:72  model 01602 from Trumpeter. I've spied opportunities for electronics in this kit but not added any yet.

## Notes

Nanchang Y-5 – (Yun-5, Yunshuji:transport) - is the Chinese version of Soviet Antonov An-2 employed as a light utility/transport biplane.

It was manufactured by [Hongdu Aviation Industry Group Ltd.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hongdu) (HAIG) (Chinese: 洪都航空工业集团), formerly China Nanchang Aircraft Manufacturing Corporation or CNAMC, is a Chinese aircraft manufacturer and supplier to the Chinese military. It is based in Nanchang, Jiangxi and is a subsidiary of the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC).

Three reasons why I was interested in building this kit

* it's quite an historic subject, and one I was not familiar with
* the Trumpeter kit is perhaps representative of their early work, which I was keen to take a closer look at
* the size of the model at 1:72 scale probably offers many options for packing in some electronics (TLDR - I didn't/haven't yet - see more below)

## The Kit

Trumpeter has a number of variants of the Antonov An-2 Colt/Nanchang Y-5 in their current line-up,
but they all appear to be based on an original tool from the 1990's.

The model is very basic - not much detail in the cockpit for example - and has a number of fit issues.
This is not surprising, as the tool dates back to the early days of Trumpeter.

The kit unfortunately suffered a little damage in transit - the canopy was shattered.
Rather than bother with a replacement, or give up completely, I did the best fix I could including replacing some missing parts.
In retrospect, perhaps I should have taken this as a cue to build a junkyard Y-5 diorama.

Basic assembly was quite straight-froward. There is not much flash, but lots of seamlines to clean up.
Fit is not great, but doesn't present very serious difficulties.

## Paint

Trumpeter kit provides decals and basic paint guide for two versions - an An-2 Colt in Polish service, and the Nanchang Y-5 in Chinese service.
There are no detailed references provided, and I've been unable to find any other material on the Y-5 "080" depicted.
This aircraft was used so widely, there are literally hundreds of possible schemes.

I decided to follow the suggested Nanchang Y-5 080

| Part                         | Paint Used |
|------------------------------|------|
| interior walls               | 70.907 Pale Grey Blue |
| body                         | 70.842 Gloss White |
| prop, engine cowling, wheels | 70.861 Black |
| engine                       | Humbrol 53 Gunmetal |
| livery stripes               | 70.909 Vermillion |
| livery stripes               | 70.963 Medium Blue |
| prop tips                    | 70.953 Flat Yellow |
| gloss finish                 | Humbrol Clear Gloss |

A couple of new techniques I practiced on this build:

* one helluva masking job to spray paint the red and blue trim. Turned out ok, with not too much touch-up required.
* first time I've tried a Humbrol Clear Gloss coat before decals. I'll never go back - the clear coat allows the decals to go down so easily and provides exceptional protection for the undelying paint (so not much risk of damage by decal setters/fixers).

## Finishing the Build

Final gloss coat, spars (Qw-Model 0.13mm Q04007 super fine) and the antenna (Qw-Model 0.047mm Q04004 super fine) and I'm calling this done for now..

## Electronics?

There is plenty of room in the kit at this scale to easily add electronics:

* motor for the propeller
* navigation lights
* interior lights

I decided not to go ahead with any of these modifications at this point, mainly because I had concerns starting out whether the kit would turn out any good, and because of the broken canopy.

Having finished this version, I think I would happily attempt another including electronics. But to use this kit again I would:

* look for some photo-etch for interior detail (apparently Extratech have some)
* perhaps scratch-build some interior detail
* put a lot more work (read: putty or sprue-glue) into fixing the fit issues

Perhaps Trumpeter will one day do a new tool for the 1:72 kit. IT might also be worth looking at the
