# #600 The Red Eyed Space Marine

Inspired by all the mad miniature skills out there these days, I delve into the world of space marines.
Since my novice paint skills are not going to rock the world, I bring some special magic in the form of eyes that glow - no wires or batteries.

Here's a quick demo..

## Notes

My first miniature - starting with a classic Games Workshop Space Marine thanks to a freebie from a local hobby store.
I've always been intrigued by the miniature scene, but never really indulged my curiosity.
Perhaps getting into the [Small Subjects](http://www.boxdioramas.com/smallsubjects) podcast finally pushed me over the edge.

It doesn't take long to realise that miniatures require a whole new set of mad skills, and the standard of work out there is absolutely incredible.
I bindged to a range of miniature artists on YouTube to get the leg up I needed -
especially [@lyla.mev](https://www.youtube.com/c/LylaMev) and [@trovarion](https://youtu.be/xNjImmO1uZs).

So I know my painting skills are not going to be the best right out of the gate - but there is some special magic I can bring to the table.
The goal here is a space marine with glowing eyes - and no wires or batteries.

## The Kit

This all started at [HobbyMate](https://goo.gl/maps/v5nUVQoJa1TZKPDT6) - a local hobby store that is superb
for all manner of materials and paints. The owner was kind enough to give me a free sprue of a basic Primaris Intercessors aka a free bag of crack?

## The Electronics

This uses the simple wireless power transmission circuit I've tested earlier in LEAP#597.

The power transmitter is a 1.5V oscillator similar to joule thief circuit.
As a I discovered later, the device sense protocol of wireless charging mats also powers the circuit beutifully (flashing rather than continuously on).

## Build

Head carefully hollowed out and an 0402 red LED inserted, with wires that will go down through the body.

First test - wireless power transmitter below the base
![build_02_first_test](./assets/build_02_first_test.jpg?raw=true)

Relatively complete: some of the detail still petty crude and should be tidied up a bit. Enough contrast - maybe?

![build_03b](./assets/build_03b.jpg?raw=true)

On a wireless charging mat. The device sense protocol is probing for a device to charge - this is enough to power the space marine and blink the eyes;-)
