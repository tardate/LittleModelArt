# #599 Kawanishi K5Y1 Tensegrity Stand

Experimenting with tensegrity model mounting, using as a subject the ARII 1:72 Kawanishi K5Y1 赤とんぼ (Willow).

## Notes

Was it just me that noticed [Tensegrity sculptures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensegrity) become a thing in 2020 all over tiktok and the socials? The concept is nothing new - a structural principle involving isolated components under compression inside a network of continuous tension. In its most drammatic form, it can make structures appear to float:

This model build started as an idle thought experiment. Could tensgrity principles be used to mount a model plane apparently "in flight"?

Turns out the answer is yes! It is however highly dependent on the aircraft geometry.
Besides being an interesting subject, the Kawanishi K5Y1 works well given
the fixed landing gear and relatively forward centre of gravity.

### The Subject

The K5Y1 is the Imperial Japanese Navy two-seat intermediate trainer version of the
[Kawanishi/Yokosuka K5Y](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokosuka_K5Y). It was nicknamed
[赤とんぼ / Akatombo / Red Dragonfly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akatombo)
and had the allied reporting name of Willow.

I first encountered the plane when I learned
[from the arawasi blog](http://arawasi-wildeagles.blogspot.com/2021/03/kawanishiyokosuka-k5y1-akatonbo-willow.html)
there is a full size replica in the
[Nishiki Secret Base Museum](https://goo.gl/maps/WrxG3Mx5ymYj8E8V6).

### The Kit

I found the [ARII 1:72 Willow kit](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/arii-7-kawanishi-k5y1-type-93-willow--157804)
in the racks of a local hobby store [Hobby Point](https://goo.gl/maps/9nDDGqUz8kTB9upKA)

It is a pretty old kit (1995) molded in brittle orange plastic with quite a bit of flash. Details are not great and fit is so-so.
But it is an interesting subject!

### Construction

![build_01_primed](./assets/build_01_primed.jpg?raw=true)

Pilot features were not molded very clearly. I did my best to give them real faces - seems to work at a distance but not up to close inspection.

A quick 360˚ around the finished model:

### The Tensegrity Stand

This in-progress shot shows the basic tensegrity principle pretty clearly:

* landing gear hang down from a hard-point
* with the plane angled down, the centre of gravity is pushed over the landing gear (I was prepared to, but turned out I didn't need to add any extra weight inside the body for this)
* a second hard-point is used to tie down the tail to prevent it tipping forward

The result is quite pleasing - the place is slightly "hovering" above the stand. And it has a nice wobble when nudged.
Next time I should get some transparent fishing line - the white cotton was the best option I had on hand.
