## Notes

In June 1943, after its defeat in the Guadalcanal Campaign, the IJN realized it needed high-speed military transport vessels, and designed two classes of ship in response.
Prior to this, they had lost too many destroyers employed as transporters.
These high-speed transport vessels were actually developed by the IJN and IJA in cooperation(!).

[No.1-class landing ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No.1-class_landing_ship)  (第一号型輸送艦,, Dai 1 Gō-gata Yusōkan)

* a 1500 ton mothership of the Daihatsu-class landing craft and Kō-hyōteki-class submarines
* Their primary role was that of a transporter, however since their armaments were strong they were useful as multi-purpose ships at the front, functioning as transporters, as minelayers and as escort ships.
* Most of these vessels were sent to the Battle of Leyte and transportation duty of the Bonin Islands.

* a 900-ton amphibious assault ship
* Most of the Navy vessels took part in the Battle of Leyte, where 18 of them were lost. Most, however, succeeded in landing their tanks and troops.
* a detailed record of the vessels in the Army service is not known to exist.
* Some example tabular records of movement:
