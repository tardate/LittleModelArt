## Notes

The [Tachikawa KKY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachikawa_KKY)
was designed as a light ambulance aircraft. Only 21 were produced, and it was used in the
Second Sino-Japanese War between 1936 and 1940.

The initial prototype and production machines as depicted in this kit were designated KKY or KKY-1.
They are distinguished by the four cylinder air-cooled, inverted inline Cirrus Hermes IV engine.
The British Cirrus-Hermes Engineering Company was formed in 1931, but taken over by Blackburn Aeroplane & Motor Company in 1934.

The later KKY-2 variant switched to the 150 hp Gasuden Jimpu seven cylinder radial engine.

### The Kit

According to [scalemates](https://www.scalemates.com/topics/topic.php?id=151881), Amodel is
the only manufacturer to have produced a model of the KKY.

Amodel is a Ukrainian model company. Their kits are distributed by IBG of Poland
and available direct from [IBG](http://en.ibg.com.pl/en,producent,amodel,7,1,name,asc.html).

### Build Log

I initially primed in black and then sprayed white.
The result was coming up too "cold", so I subsequently gave it a light undercoat of
cork brown before finishing in white.

The cockpit and canopy needed a lot of fettling to get a good fit.
With this kit it is well worth taking the time before paint and glue to make sure the fit is true.
Luckily I was warned of this by [@tochi.nocchi](https://www.instagram.com/tochi.nocchi/).

As I was going to display the model in-flight, I needed at least a pilot.
there are no figures in the kit, so I grabbed one from my misc spares box - I think an Airfix pilot.

The prop was an experiment using some 1:32 plywood texture decals from [proper.plane](https://properplane.com/accessories_and_decal) to imitate a wood finish. I like the "impression" and it was easy, but perhaps doesn't have the detail I've seen some get with good old brush and paints

Whipping up a quick based with some scrap board and a rough surface sculpted from papier-mâché.

And we have take-off! The pose is inspired by the box art.
