## Notes

The [Mitsubishi A6M Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_A6M_Zero) was a long-range carrier-based fighter aircraft.

I picked up this kit for only ¥640 at [LeonardoレオナルドLG ２](https://goo.gl/maps/vD6QRryerktowoct8),
mainly because I was keen to try as I'd heard really good things about Sweet kits. And oh my, it is a nice little kit.
The detail is very impressive for the scale, despite this being one of their older kits.
