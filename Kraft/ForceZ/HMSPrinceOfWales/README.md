Remembering Force Z with a build of the HMS Prince Of Wales from the Tamiya 1:700 waterline series. No electronics for this one.

## Notes

As we approached the 80th anniversary of the sinking of HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse,
I noticed that Tamiya have a representation of all the vessels in their 1:700 waterline series.

Will I make them all? Perhaps! I completed
the Australian destroyer [HMAS Vampire](../HMASVampire) and have now added HMS Prince Of Wales to the collection.
Perhaps I'll keep HMS Repulse for next year?

### Force Z

[Force Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_Z) sailed from Singapore at 1710 on 8 December 1941 after receiving word of a Japanese convoy bound for Malaya.
It consisted of
the battleship [HMS Prince of Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Prince_of_Wales_(53)),
battlecruiser [HMS Repulse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Repulse_(1916)),
with destroyer escorts
[HMS Electra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Electra_(H27)),
[HMS Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Express_(H61)),
[HMAS Vampire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS_Vampire_(D68)) and
[HMS Tenedos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Tenedos_(H04)).

On 9 December 1941, Japanese submarine and reconnaissance aircraft reported on Force Z without their knowledge.
HMS Tenedos was also detected to return to Singapore as she was running low on fuel.
Overnight, flares dropped by Japanese aircraft alerted Force Z to their discovery.
Having lost the element of surprise, the force was ordered to return to Singapore.

On the return voyage, the force was intercepted by land-based bombers and torpedo bombers of the Imperial Japanese Navy.
Prince of Wales and Repulse were sunk by Japanese aircraft on 10 December 1941.
Destroyers Electra and Vampire moved in to rescue survivors of Repulse, while Express rescued those from the Prince of Wales.

Occurring just a few days after the Pearl Harbor attacks, this was Britain's turn to learn how vulnerable capital ships were to air power.
There was no attempt to alert or scramble RAF air cover for Force Z, though it is likely to have made little difference
as the number and vintage of the planes on hand were totally outclassed by the Japanese forces in play.

### HMS Prince Of Wales

[HMS Prince Of Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Prince_of_Wales_(53)) was the second of the King George V-class battleships.
She was commissioned on 19 January 1941 and had a short but storied career.

In May 1941, she accompanied HMS Hood in the hunt for the Bismarck. She scored
[three hits against the German battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Denmark_Strait#Prince_of_Wales_alone),
forcing it to return to port for repairs and abandon the attempt to break out into the Atlantic.

In October Prince of Wales and a destroyer escort left home waters bound for Singapore, arriving 2 December.
Force Z was her first action out of Singapore. The
[wreck](https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?pagename=HMS_Prince_of_Wales_(53)&params=3_33_36_N_104_28_42_E_)
in the South China Sea about 260km NNE from Singapore

The wreck lies upside down in 223 feet (68 m) of water at [3°33′36″N 104°28′42″E](https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?pagename=HMS_Prince_of_Wales_(53)&params=3_33_36_N_104_28_42_E_) (about 260km NNE of Singapore).
 The wreck site was designated a Protected Place in 2001 under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986.

#### The Kit

The
[Tamiya kit No. 31615](https://www.tamiya.com/english/products/31615prince/index.htm)
is a in 1:700 waterline rendition of the HMS Prince of Wales.
Thi sis an old tooling from 1975 but it still stands up to scrutiny. Later boxings I think included the extra detail sprues.

#### Photo-etch Customization

While the Tamiya kit is a reasonably well detailed, I think it needs some PE to bring it to life, even if just for the railings.

I'm using a pretty wonderful photo-etch set from
[White Ensign Models (PE 738, 1:700)](https://www.whiteensignmodels.com/p/WEM+1700+King+George+V+Class+Battleship+PE+738/5467/#.YaRXQfFByL4)
that caters for all ships in the King George V Class.

###### Figures

Adding some figures brings the deck to life.
I'm using a set from ION Model:
[Royal Navy - Chilling on deck No. R700-001 1:700](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/ion-model-r700-001-royal-navy-chilling-on-deck-1-700--1352340)

They publish a useful [guide to preparing and painting](http://ionmodel.com/post_tutorials/working-with-1-700-figures-by-ramir-dura/)

###### Construction

Making a start on the Tamiya 1:700 HMS Prince of Wales. This White Ensign PE will keep me busy for a bit! #scalemodel

![build01a](./assets/build01a.jpg?raw=true)

![build01b](./assets/build01b.jpg?raw=true)

Yeah just for scale: that's how big my glass of wine had to be to deal with all that PE

![build01c](./assets/build01c.jpg?raw=true)

![build01d](./assets/build01d.jpg?raw=true)

In progress - HMS Prince of Wales (Tamiya 1:700). Doing the PE rails *after* the dazzle camo and deck turned out to be a good choice. Final stretch now.

![build01e](./assets/build01e.jpg?raw=true)
![build01f](./assets/build01f.jpg?raw=true)
![build01g](./assets/build01g.jpg?raw=true)

![build01i](./assets/build01i.jpg?raw=true)
![build01j](./assets/build01j.jpg?raw=true)

Still (always) more to do, but pottering away on my HMS Prince of Wales makes for a quiet meditation on the events of 80 years ago, just a few hundred miles north of my QTH

![build01k](./assets/build01k.jpg?raw=true)
![build01l](./assets/build01l.jpg?raw=true)

Rigging and antenna fixups

![build02c](./assets/build02c.jpg?raw=true)
![build02d](./assets/build02d.jpg?raw=true)

Itsy bitsy crew from @ionmodel that will be perfect on my 1:700 builds. Painting will be like 1 molecule of flesh tone to 3 molecules of navy;-) Got these after seeing @r.o.hobbypasion post, maybe these were used on his jaw-dropping Juan Carlos I L-61 diorama?

![build03a](./assets/build03a.jpg?raw=true)

OK finally discovered something more finicky than hand-soldering 0603 SMT LEDs: painting 1:700 figures

![build03b](./assets/build03b.jpg?raw=true)

Srsly, was the Walrus really worth all the trouble😎!!?... creating a few dramas on deck with these beaut little @ionmodel 1:700 RN crew (on the still-more-to-go HMS Prince of Wales)

![build03c](./assets/build03c.jpg?raw=true)

Planning a seascape base, the foam on photo-frame technique ($2 from Daiso)...

![build04a](./assets/build04a.jpg?raw=true)

Planning my seascape for HMS Prince of Wales aka "Time Tunnel 1941"

![build04b](./assets/build04b.jpg?raw=true)

Making waves today😊 .. HMS Prince of Wales (Tamiya 1:700, White Ensign PE and crewed by #ionmodel)
