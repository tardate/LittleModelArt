Remembering Force Z with a build of the HMAS Vampire from the Tamiya 1:700 waterline series.
No electronics for this one.

## Notes

As we are coming up to the 80th anniversary of the sinking of HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse,
I noticed that Tamiya have a representation of all the vessels in their 1:700 waterline series.

Will I make them all? Perhaps! For now, I've started with the Australian destroyer [HMAS Vampire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS_Vampire_(D68)).

### Force Z

[Force Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_Z) sailed from Singapore at 1710 on 8 December 1941 after receiving word of a Japanese convoy bound for Malaya.
It consisted of
the battleship [HMS Prince of Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Prince_of_Wales_(53)),
battlecruiser [HMS Repulse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Repulse_(1916)),
with destroyer escorts
[HMS Electra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Electra_(H27)),
[HMS Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Express_(H61)),
[HMAS Vampire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS_Vampire_(D68)) and
[HMS Tenedos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Tenedos_(H04)).

On 9 December 1941, Japanese submarine and reconnaissance aircraft reported on Force Z without their knowledge.
HMS Tenedos was also detected to return to Singapore as she was running low on fuel.
Overnight, flares dropped by Japanese aircraft alerted Force Z to their discovery.
Having lost the element of surprise, the force was ordered to return to Singapore.

On the return voyage, the force was intercepted by land-based bombers and torpedo bombers of the Imperial Japanese Navy.
Prince of Wales and Repulse were sunk by Japanese aircraft on 10 December 1941.
Destroyers Electra and Vampire moved in to rescue survivors of Repulse, while Express rescued those from the Prince of Wales.

Occurring just a few days after the Pearl Harbor attacks, this was Britain's turn to learn how vulnerable capital ships were to air power.
There was no attempt to alert or scramble RAF air cover for Force Z, though it is likely to have made little difference
as the number and vintage of the planes on hand were totally outclassed by the Japanese forces in play.

## Construction

I decided to build, prime and paint by sub-assembly this time, as there are nooks and crannies that will be hard to reach after full assembly.

![build_01_primed_subassemblies](./assets/build_01_primed_subassemblies.jpg?raw=true)

I've only used the railings from the PE set so far.

![build_02_with_railings](./assets/build_02_with_railings.jpg?raw=true)

Adding the ships boats.

![build_03_with_ships_boats](./assets/build_03_with_ships_boats.jpg?raw=true)

Ready for decals next I think.

![build_04](./assets/build_04.jpg?raw=true)

Decals added, ready for weathering and a base.

![build_05](./assets/build_05.jpg?raw=true)

After weathering and adding some rigging.

![build_06a](./assets/build_06a.jpg?raw=true)
![build_06b](./assets/build_06b.jpg?raw=true)

A watery base. some fine touchups still to do

![build_07b](./assets/build_07b.jpg?raw=true)

As far as I've taken it so far.
The model base forms part of a [20 x 12 x 9cm acrylic display case](https://shopee.sg/-BLESIYA-Acrylic-Display-Box-Transparent-Plastic-Protection-Case-for-Toys-Collection-i.140392305.2995490477).
