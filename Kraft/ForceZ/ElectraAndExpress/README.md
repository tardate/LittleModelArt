# #730 Electra And Express To the Rescue

HMS Electra (H27) and HMS Express (H61) race to protect HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse as a wave of G3M Nell torpedo bombers press their attack on 10 December 1941. No electronics in this one.

## Notes

10 December 1941:
[Force Z is attacked in the South China Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_Prince_of_Wales_and_Repulse#The_Japanese_air_attack),
sinking the Battleship HMS Prince of Wales and battlecruiser HMS Repulse.

At around 11:40, 17 Nell torpedo bombers (two squadrons from the Genzan Air Group) approached the two capital ships. Eight concentrated on Repulse, while nine attacked Prince of Wales, sending eight torpedoes speeding towards the flagship (one plane aborted its run on Prince of Wales and peeled off and attacked Repulse).[44] One Nell was shot down and three more were damaged by the Prince of Wales anti-aircraft fire during this attack.

The destroyers Electra and Vampire moved in to rescue survivors of Repulse, while Express rescued those from the Prince of Wales.

This scene depicts the destroyers

and
[HMS Express (H61)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Express_(H61))
racing to protect the capital ships as a wave of G3M Nell torpedo bombers press their attack.

NB: this continues my annual memorial-in-models of the fated expedition that once and for all proved the vulnerability of ships to air attack. I've previously built HMS Prince of Wales and HMAS Vampire and have HMS Repulse queued up for next year, completing the British task force for the 83rd anniversary.

#### Photo-etch Customization

While the Tamiya kit is a reasonably well detailed, I think it needs some PE to bring it to life.

I'm using a photo-etch set from
[White Ensign Models (PE 766, 1:700)](https://www.whiteensignmodels.com/p/WEM+1700+E+F+Class+Destroyer+PE+766/5500/)
that caters for all ships in the E & F Destroyer Class.

The main benefit came from the railings. I left many parts unused because they were not well scaled or not a greta improvement over the kits parts.

Here are my notes on how the PE was applied:

| PE | Name                               | Used |
