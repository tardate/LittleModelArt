## Notes

Who can resist a bit of candy? Obviously not me, as the bright red G-Fire scheme sold me on this kit.
Not doing anything special with it - just a clean out-of-the-box build that I've had running in the background for a while.

### The Kit

The [Airfix Supermarine Spitfire Mk.XIV](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/airfix-a05139-supermarine-spitfire-mkxiv-civilian-schemes--1260842) comes with a couple of striking civilian schemes. The kit goes together beautifully and is reasonably well detailed. I think the tool is from 2019, while these schemes are in the 2020 boxing.

### The Subject

The [Spitfire Mk.XIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarine_Spitfire_(Griffon-powered_variants)#Mk_XIV_(type_379))

### Construction

This is a nice new 2019 tooling and fit is great. And with only 118 parts, it goes together in no time.

The cockpit has a enough detail that I didn't mind going with the out-of-the-box parts and decals. "Perfect Pits" enthusiasts would probably want a whole lot more after-market though.
