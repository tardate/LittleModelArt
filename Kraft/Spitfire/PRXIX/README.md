## Notes

The first Mk XIXs entered service in May 1944, and by the end of the war the type had virtually replaced the earlier Mk XI. A total of 225 were built with production ceasing in early 1946, but they were used in front line RAF service until April 1954.

### Kit

The Supermarine Spitfire PR.XIX (A02017W)
included in the
[D-Day Duo Airfix Club Limited Edition Airfix No. A73016 1:72](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/airfix-a73016-d-day-duo--1514520)
is I believe a repackaging of the
[Airfix kit A02017B](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/airfix-a02017b-supermarine-spitfire-prxix--1523804) kit.

### Paint Scheme

In the  D-Day Duo kit, there is one decal scheme that I have followed: No 541 Squadron RAF Benson Oxfordshire 1944
