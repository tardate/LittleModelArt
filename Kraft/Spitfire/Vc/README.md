## Notes

### The Kit

The kit - [Supermarine Spitfire Mk.Vc; Airfix No. A02108, 1:72](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/airfix-a02108-supermarine-spitfire-mkvc--1260494) - is a nice new mould from 2020.

![kit_box](./assets/kit_box.jpg?raw=true)

I'm modelling ER180 - US Army Air Force 307 FS, 31 FG MX-P / ER180

### The Build

![build01a](./assets/build01a.jpg?raw=true)

The cockpit is reasonable well detailed out of the box

![build01b](./assets/build01b.jpg?raw=true)

These recent (2020) Airfix tools are impressively engineered. Construction was a breeze with minimal seam-lines to deal with.

![build01c](./assets/build01c.jpg?raw=true)

I realised I fluffed the tail camo after the fact - my usual problem of confusing and mirroring the masking (on the right tail plane).

![build02a](./assets/build02a.jpg?raw=true)
![build02b](./assets/build02b.jpg?raw=true)
![build02c](./assets/build02c.jpg?raw=true)
![build03a](./assets/build03a.jpg?raw=true)

decals done and wire attached for an in-flight pose

![build03b](./assets/build03b.jpg?raw=true)

ready for finishing

![build03c](./assets/build03c.jpg?raw=true)
![build03d](./assets/build03d.jpg?raw=true)

enhancing the panel lines (Tamiya black panel line accent)

![build04a](./assets/build04a.jpg?raw=true)
![build04b](./assets/build04b.jpg?raw=true)

Time to start dirtying up that sweet finish with some oils

![build05a](./assets/build05a.jpg?raw=true)
![build05b](./assets/build05b.jpg?raw=true)

using pastels to break up the finish and add some dust effects

![build07a](./assets/build07a.jpg?raw=true)
![build07b](./assets/build07b.jpg?raw=true)
![build07c](./assets/build07c.jpg?raw=true)

### Planning the Diorama

It was the box-art of the Airfix A02108 kit that really drew me to build it in the first place,
so no surprise that it inspires the choice of presentation.

I'm building a simple base on a tile to represent Algerian desert, with Spitfire causing a little havoc amongst
some German targets of opportunity.

The target convoy will be in a smaller scale so that the aircraft remains the focus with some forced-perspective.
I have a few options in mind for vehicles:

* Hauler 1:120  TIGER I ausf E and Staff Car
* Pit-Road 1/144 German vehicles
* Pit-Road 1/700 German vehicles

I have some of these on order. Interested to see how far I can push the forced-perspective!

### Diorama Base

Starting to build a base on a tile.
The LEDs I've wired in have a candle-flicker effect, powered from 3V coin cell holder also built into the base

![build06a](./assets/build06a.jpg?raw=true)

used tile grout this time and I like the texture it brings

![build06b](./assets/build06b.jpg?raw=true)

trying the black-basing approach for groundwork

![build06c](./assets/build06c.jpg?raw=true)

an hour or so in the spray booth working through a progression of colours

![build06d](./assets/build06d.jpg?raw=true)

#### LED Effects

This is really simple, as I have some
[5mm Yellow Blinking Candle Effect LEDs](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32782781815.html) from aliexpress.
With a 3V coin cell, they light perfectly and don't even need a current-limiting resistor.

### Trial Assembly

attaching to the base
![build08a](./assets/build08a.jpg?raw=true)

Spinning prop and candle-flicker effects in the explosion... about as far as I can take this for now -
waiting for some vehicle kits to populate the base

![build09a](./assets/build09a.jpg?raw=true)
![build09b](./assets/build09b.jpg?raw=true)
![build09c](./assets/build09c.jpg?raw=true)

### 1:120 Convoy

I received these fabulous little resin+PE kits from Hauler in 1:120 scale:

* [Tiger I Ausf. E; Hauler No. HTT120002, 1:120](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/hauler-htt120002-tiger-i-ausf-e--109252)
* [Opel Kapitän German staff car (hardtop); Hauler No. HTT120076, 1:120](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/hauler-htt120076-german-staff-car-hardtop-2-in-set--1200533)

#### Tiger I Ausf. E

The [Hauler kit No. HTT120002](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/hauler-htt120002-tiger-i-ausf-e--109252)
comes in cast resin with a PE sheet and some decals.
The decals include at least 3 schemes.

A beautiful little build:

![build10a](./assets/build10a.jpg?raw=true)
![build10b](./assets/build10b.jpg?raw=true)

A quick paint job to get this beast on the diorama without delay.

![build10c](./assets/build10c.jpg?raw=true)

I'll probably come back for some finer weathering later...

![build10d](./assets/build10d.jpg?raw=true)

#### Opel Kapitän

The [Hauler kit No. HTT120076](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/hauler-htt120076-german-staff-car-hardtop-2-in-set--1200533)
comes with two vehicles. Basically the resin cast and some PE+decal number plates.

![build11a](./assets/build11a.jpg?raw=true)

"Construction" primarily means cleaning up the printing supports!

![build11b](./assets/build11b.jpg?raw=true)

A quick paint job:

![build11c](./assets/build11c.jpg?raw=true)

No weathering to speak of, just a simple camo scheme for now..

![build11d](./assets/build11d.jpg?raw=true)

#### Final Diorama (1:72, 1:120 Scale)

Testing with the convoy vehicles after priming but before they are painted and finished:

![build12a](./assets/build12a.jpg?raw=true)

Some initial shots after painting the convoy vehicles.

The 1:72 to 1:120 forced-perspective seems to work fine.
I still have some Pit-road 1:144 and 1:700 on the way to try later to see how far I can push it.

![build13a](./assets/build13a.jpg?raw=true)
![build13b](./assets/build13b.jpg?raw=true)
![build13c](./assets/build13c.jpg?raw=true)
![build13d](./assets/build13d.jpg?raw=true)
![build13e](./assets/build13e.jpg?raw=true)

How it now looks compared to the box art:

![build13f](./assets/build13f.jpg?raw=true)

### Revised with a 1:144 Convoy

I was interseted in pushing the forced-perspective experiment further with a 1:144 convoy.
I picked up the new 2020 tool Pit-Road kit of
[WWII German army military vehicles set 1 No. SGK02 1:144](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/pit-road-sgk02-wwii-german-army-military-vehicles-set-1--1305590).

The molding is sublime, and the kit contains parts for 2 each of:

* Kfz. 305 Opel Blitz
* Pz.Kpfw. II Ausf. F
* Sd.Kfz. 250
* Sd.Kfz. 251

I built a few of the vehicles and gave them a quick desert camo paintjob:

![build14a](./assets/build14a.jpg?raw=true)

NB: I did also checkout [Pit-Road WWII German Military Vehicle Set 1 No. MI02](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/pit-road-mi02-wwii-german-military-vehicle-set-1--1338389), but I think the 1:700 scale is a bit too extreme for this diorama.

#### Updated Diorama (1:72, 1:144 Scale)

Some updated shots with the new convoy vehicles and re-scaled the "explosion" to suit.

![build14b](./assets/build14b.jpg?raw=true)

The 1:72 to 1:144 forced-perspective seems to work even better; even closer to the box art.

![build15a](./assets/build15a.jpg?raw=true)
![build15b](./assets/build15b.jpg?raw=true)

## Never Finished

OK, after calling this done for a second time, I came back to fiddle the groundwork and decal the convoy.

[build16a](./assets/build16a.jpg?raw=true)
[build16b](./assets/build16b.jpg?raw=true)
[build16c](./assets/build16c.jpg?raw=true)
[build16d](./assets/build16d.jpg?raw=true)
[build16e](./assets/build16e.jpg?raw=true)
[build17a](./assets/build17a.jpg?raw=true)
[build17b](./assets/build17b.jpg?raw=true)
[build17c](./assets/build17c.jpg?raw=true)
[build17d](./assets/build17d.jpg?raw=true)

Maybe now I can say I'm finished?
