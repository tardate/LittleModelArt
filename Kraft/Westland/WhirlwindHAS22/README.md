### Build Log

Maybe bobble heads, but nice that Airfix actually include a couple of figures in the kit.

For a 1956 tooling, the fit is not to bad at all, though the clear parts don't fit all that well.

The new 2022 decals are very nice, and the overall result is quite pleasing. I didn't sweat the details too much - a nice simple little build.
