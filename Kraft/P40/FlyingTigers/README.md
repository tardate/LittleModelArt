## Notes

The Hawk 81A-2 is an export version of the [P-40B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtiss_P-40_Warhawk_variants#P-40B),
with 110 aircraft produced for the RAF as Tomahawk Mk.IIs and Mk.IIAs.
Apparently some ended up with the [Flying Tigers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Tigers) in Kunming, China.

The aircraft depicted in this
[Airfix A01003 1:72 kit](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/airfix-a01003-curtiss-hawk-81-a-2--131395)
was flown by Flight Leader Charles H. Older,
Third Squadron, American Volunteer Group, Kunming, China, 1942.

It sports the roundels of the Republic of China, and a "Flying Tiger" insignia that was created by the Walt Disney Company.

### Paint Scheme

### Build Log

I love the way Airfix designed the cockpit to be built up on the wing, with the fuselage fitting neatly over the top.

I seem to have not taken any more WIP shots. So straight from painting and decaling:

![build02b](./assets/build02b.jpg?raw=true)

![build02c](./assets/build02c.jpg?raw=true)

![build02d](./assets/build02d.jpg?raw=true)

With an antenna aerial rigged:

Although just simple decals, the cockpit dashboard is nicely visible through the canopy

![build03c](./assets/build03c.jpg?raw=true)

It does look quite menacing if you need to stare it down!

The Airfix 1/72 Flying Tigers P-40B joins its little brother - [AFVClub 1/144](../AFVClub68).
