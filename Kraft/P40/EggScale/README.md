## Notes

Since I accidentlly started building a few P-40 Flying Tiger machines, I couldn't resist this
[Tiger Model 1:Egg scale](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/tiger-model-tm-106-curtiss-p-40-warhawk--971184)
kit.

### Paint Scheme

The kits can be built totally unpainted with stickers or painted with decals.
I went with airbrush and decals in most cases.

### Build Log

A quick test build takes only a few minutes. The assembly is fabulous - everything positively locates.
I can image this being a fun "quick build" for someone who just wanted to slap it together and apply the stickers.
Thankfully markings are supplied as both stickers and water-slide decals.

The kit provides for 3 dashboard options: stickers on plain dashboard; decals on plain dashboard; painted raised-detail dashboard. I went for the later.

There are no masks for the canopy, so did it old school with lots of bits of Tamiya masking tape.

![build02b](./assets/build02b.jpg?raw=true)

Decalled and ready for final assembly.
