# #581 PLA Navy Type 054A

Building the Trumpeter 1:700 PLAN 054A Frigate (no electronics - yet).

## Notes

My first ship model in many decades. I wasn't sure I had much of an attraction for modern warships until I actually started the build.
I was quite intrigued by the modern PLA Navy, and once I started working on the model, I must admit the sleek lines had me suckered completely.

The [Type 054A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_054A_frigate) is a multi-role frigate with impressive air-defence and anti-submarine capabilities,
and the class first entered service in 2005.
The 黄山/Huangshan (570) I've modelled here is still in active service.

In retrospect, I think I chose the wrong scale. At 1:700, the Trumpeter kit has noticeable structural differences from photos I've seen of the ships, and there's not much scope for even photo-etch to make up for missing detail.

It also turned out to be a bit too small to do anything particularly interesting with custom electronics.
I've set my eye on some 1:350 subjects for Trumpeter to have another go.

Nevertheless, I'm now quite enamoured with this ship, and look forward to adding a few more PLA Navy subjects to the stash/display shelf.

## The Kit

I got my kit from the [Colorfulday Store on Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001315096301.html). All arrived in good order..

## Construction

So it's been a while. And I think my first mistake was assembling the desk and hull before painting the desk (I turned out to be a helluva challenge).

Primed and partially assembled:
