### The Kit

I have the [PLAN Type 051C  Trumpeter 04529 1:350](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/trumpeter-04529-ddg-115-shenyang-plan--106439)
kit. It contains decals to build both DDG-115 and DGD-116, the two ships of the class.

This is the first 1:350 ship kit I've built. I'm finding it a bit too large to be as satisfying as the 1:700 ships I've built,
mainly because they are a large canvas that demands detail - detail that is not in the it or even with basic photoetch enhancements.

I compensated somewhat by adding greeblies, railings and rigging.

### Paint Scheme

| Feature              | Color                | Recommended | Paint Used        |
|----------------------|----------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| radar domes          | White                | H1          | 70.993 White Grey |
| propellers           | Gold                 | H9          | 70.878 Old Gold   |
| lower hull           | Hull Red/Cocoa Brown | H17         |                   |
| funnel tops          | Flat Black           | H12         | H12               |
| hull, superstructure | IJN Gray             | H61         | H61               |
| deck                 | Engine Gray FS16081  | H339        | H83               |

## Electronics

I installed a series of red LEDs (0604 SMD) powered by a CR2032 coin cell:

* 2 in the bridge, diffused with some translucent model clay
* 5 along the exposed corridors

## Build Log

I carved out the bridge windows and fitted some tinted windows (IC component bags)

![build01a](./assets/build01a.jpg?raw=true)

This is not a drill! Bridge is lit with a soft glow of red LEDs diffused with translucent model clay

![build01b](./assets/build01b.jpg?raw=true)

Basic assembly complete

![build01c](./assets/build01c.jpg?raw=true)

I realise now that the decals are not accurate to the actual white-on-black currently sported by DDG-115.

![build02b](./assets/build02b.jpg?raw=true)

Greeblies and aerials copied from some reference photos... at 1:350, the ship really demands more detail than is provided by the kit and standard photoetch.

![build02c](./assets/build02c.jpg?raw=true)

![build03a](./assets/build03a.jpg?raw=true)
![build03b](./assets/build03b.jpg?raw=true)
![build03c](./assets/build03c.jpg?raw=true)

![build04a](./assets/build04a.jpg?raw=true)
![build04b](./assets/build04b.jpg?raw=true)
![build04c](./assets/build04c.jpg?raw=true)

It could still do with a bit more detailing, and I've been thinking about placing it in a seascape, but that's all for now!

tbh, I think this one convinced me that 1:350 not really my scale - too much blank canvas and standard level of detail even with PE is far from convincing, so quite a big job to fill the gap. I can see myself returning to this build to add detail and weathering over the next year or more! But in the meantime I think I'll be retreating back to 1:700..
