# #661 Concorde

Last flight of the Concorde - the Airfix 1:114 with LED effects in 1970s travel-agent chic

## Notes

To my mind, Concorde was the pinnacle of our quest to conquer the sky.
Sure, I much prefer to travel on a modern Airbus, but it doesn't have the same romance.

This is a simple build of the
[Airfix 1:144 Concorde Gift Set](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/airfix-a50189-concorde--1325492)
commemorating its retirement from service.

The kits is actually very simple build, and does show its age a bit (flashy, minimal details, some poor fit).
But it achieves the most important thing - captures the wing geometry beautifully.

### Paint Scheme

It's white!

Although I had the "gift set" boxing with Humbrol paint cups,
I didn't use them.

The pain is mostly Mr Hobby Aqueous H1 gloss white,
with some black detail with Vallejo 70.950 black.

### Circuit Design

A simple LED circuit powered from a 12V adapter (because I had some spare 12V LED strip):

* each engine has two 5mm Red LEDs in series with 560Î©.
* the 12V LED strip mounted inside the passenger cabin

### Build Log

Where did the pics go? Seems like I neglected to photo the early stages of the build.

Installing the LEDs in the engine pods..

Half a styrene ball forms the stylised globe - I'm going for a 1970's travel agent chic feel.

The kit captures the wing geometry beautifully (for all its other faults).

I have it flying over my desk now;-)
