### Build Log

where I got to after a few hours on day 1 - basically just cleaned up most of the parts, did an in-flight conversion and a little priming

![build01a](./assets/build01a.jpg?raw=true)

found a resin figure to pilot the aircraft. Only got one, so it's going to be a solo training flight! Quick slap dash paint job..

![build01b](./assets/build01b.jpg?raw=true)

quick cockpit assembly, didn't sweat the details as its going to be pretty invisible in the final build

![build01c](./assets/build01c.jpg?raw=true)
![build01d](./assets/build01d.jpg?raw=true)

ok, fuselage halves coming together, getting closer to paint now

![build01e](./assets/build01e.jpg?raw=true)

Interior - wheels-up conversion

![build01f](./assets/build01f.jpg?raw=true)

Main body parts ready to assemble

![build01g](./assets/build01g.jpg?raw=true)

![build01h](./assets/build01h.jpg?raw=true)

Last chance to look inside the cockpit!

![build01i](./assets/build01i.jpg?raw=true)

![build01j](./assets/build01j.jpg?raw=true)

### Background Painting

working on a simple background for the B5 mounting frame

![build02a](./assets/build02a.jpg?raw=true)

![build02b](./assets/build02b.jpg?raw=true)

"a grand day for training" .. a quick and dirty framing

![build02c](./assets/build02c.jpg?raw=true)

### Painting the Miles Master

Where I got to on Saturday evening. Primed for yellow .. or I could just stick with this schemeüòÅ

![build03a](./assets/build03a.jpg?raw=true)

![build03b](./assets/build03b.jpg?raw=true)

![build03c](./assets/build03c.jpg?raw=true)

![build03d](./assets/build03d.jpg?raw=true)

Liking this hue of yellow. Let it dry a bit before masking for the final upper camo.

![build03e](./assets/build03e.jpg?raw=true)

Masked and applying the dark earth camo

![build03f](./assets/build03f.jpg?raw=true)

![build03g](./assets/build03g.jpg?raw=true)

Decals .. if I had more time I think I'd spray on the roundels so I could get the yellow properly matched

![build03i](./assets/build03i.jpg?raw=true)

![build03j](./assets/build03j.jpg?raw=true)

![build03k](./assets/build03k.jpg?raw=true)

### Final Gallery

"A grand day for training". All done!
