## Notes

[Sōya 宗谷 (PL107)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C5%8Dya_(PL107))
is a Japanese icebreaker that serves as a museum ship in Tokyo after a long and storied service spanning some of the 20th century's historic events. It is named for Sōya sub-prefecture in Hokkaido.

* In November 1939, the Imperial Japanese Navy requisitioned Chiryo Maru for national service. In February 1940, she was renamed Sōya.
* She was assigned duties as an auxiliary ammunition supply and survey vessel
* She survived the Second World War, albeit with multiple close calls
* After the war, she was assigned duties with the nation's repatriation fleet
* In 1949, Sōya was transferred to the Maritime Safety Agency, the precursor to the Japan Coast Guard. Her duties included supplying remote lighthouses.
* In 1950, the ship received a comprehensive refit in preparation for service as Japan's first dedicated Antarctic research ship.
* Between 1956 and 1962, Sōya undertook missions to the Antarctic (1st to the 6th).
* Sōya was fully decommissioned in 1978.
* In 1979, Sōya was moored alongside at the Museum of Maritime Science, Tokyo, and remains open to the public as a museum ship

See [IJN SOYA: Tabular Record of Movement](http://www.combinedfleet.com/Soya_t.htm) for more details, especially of wartime service.

The Sōya was the first in a line of icebreakers for Antarctic expeditions:

* [Japanese icebreaker Fuji (AGB-5001)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_icebreaker_Fuji_(AGB-5001)). Served 1965 - 1984. Now a museum ship in Nagoya.
* [Japanese icebreaker Shirase (AGB-5002)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_icebreaker_Shirase_(AGB-5002)). Served 1982 - 2008. Under remodeling into observation and exhibition facility.
* [Japanese icebreaker Shirase (AGB-5003)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_icebreaker_Shirase_(AGB-5003)). Commissioned 2009, Japan's fourth icebreaker for Antarctic expeditions. She inherited her name from her predecessor.

I got to visit Sōya in 2024 - highly recommended if you are ever visiting Tokyo.

### The Kit

[Antarctic Research Ship Soya 3rd-6th Corps Foresight No. SMP-006 1:700](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/foresight-smp-006-antarctic-research-ship-soya-3rd-6th-corps--160687) was tooled in 2003 and depicts the ship as used between the 3rd and 6th expeditions.

I added the kit to my stash in 2022, purchased for ¥2570 from Yodobashi Shinjuku.

### Project Box

I used [MakerCase](https://en.makercase.com/) to generate a simple parametric design:

* material thickness: 3mm
* inside dimensions:
    * width: 85mm
    * height: 20mm
    * depth:  203mm
* open box
* edge joints: flat
* panel layout: separate
* panel labels: disabled
* kerf: 0.2mm
* exported as [soya-box-template.svg](./assets/soya-box-template.svg)
* refined in Affinity Designer: [soya-box.afdesign](./assets/soya-box.afdesign)
* prepared for laser cutting in Inkscape: [soya-box.svg](./assets/soya-box.svg)
