## Notes

The [Subaru 360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru_360) is a rear-engined, two-door city car manufactured and marketed by Subaru from 1958 to 1971. It was the company's first mass-produced automobile, with over 392,000 produced.

The Subaru Young SS variant was a second "sports" model, featuring:

* upgraded EK32 "S" engine with chromed cylinders and dual BS32 Mikuni Solex carburetors
* upgraded transmission (4 gears instead of 3)
* bucket seats
* tachometer
* a black, white striped roof with a dent along the middle to put one's surfboard

### The Kit

I don't normally build cars, so this will be fun (and challenging)!

The Hasegawa
[No. 52291](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/hasegawa-52291-subaru-360-young-ss-w-60s-girls-figure--1359922)
is a 2021 re-boxing of their 1997 tool
1:24 Subaru 360 Young-SS, this time including a female figure.

I bought the kit in Dec 2022 for ¥2,100 at Yamada Denki LABI Shinjuku.

### Build Log

First thing I did was strip the chrome from the chrome parts.
I used Mr Muscle Bathroom Cleaner (Stain Remover), works well in 24-48 hours.

### Figure

Rather than use acrylics for the figure,
I decided to use Mr Hobby Aqueous.
I mostly used airbrush but with some hand-painted details. I used decals for the eyes, but painted other details such as eyebrows.

### Final Gallery Pics

Haven't decided on a base yet, but here it is.
I learned a lot - very happy with the chrome stripping, but I need more practice on getting a nice smooth gloss finish.
