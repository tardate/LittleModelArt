# #155 Fairey Flycatcher

Building the Fairey Flycatcher stationed at HMS Hermes, China Station, 1930. This is the Armory Models Group kit in 1:48, with a hand carved prop and wood decals from Proper Plane of Ukraine. All upstaged by a couple of cheeky seagulls.

## Notes

The Fairey Flycatcher was a British single-seat biplane carrier-borne fighter aircraft made by Fairey Aviation Company which served from 1923 to 1934. It was produced with a conventional undercarriage for carrier use, although this could be exchanged for floats for catapult use aboard capital ships.

The Fairey Flycatcher in Royal Navy service during the 1920s and early 1930s was finished in what was known as "silver dope" — a light, metallic-looking finish applied to the fabric surfaces — with metal panels usually painted in a very similar light grey-silver shade so the whole aircraft appeared a uniform pale silver.

The navigation lights on RNAS (Royal Naval Air Service) and later FAA (Fleet Air Arm) aircraft — including biplane floatplanes like the Fairey Flycatcher — followed the same international standard used for ships and aircraft since the early 20th century.

For the Fairey Flycatcher (introduced in the 1920s), the wingtip navigation lights would have been:

* Port (left) wingtip – Red light
* Starboard (right) wingtip – Green light

I made the mistake of thinking the main fabric fuselage was white, and that's how I've finished the model.
It wasn't particularly clear in the Armory instructions, but as I got towards the end of the build I started to doubt the choice.
A little research confirmed that I as wrong, and that the main fuselage should be "silver dope".
It was too late in the build to fix that without significant effort—I'd already laid down decals for instance—so
I'll just notch this up as a "lesson learned", and appreciate the build for what it is: a somewhat "what if" representation.
