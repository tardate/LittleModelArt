# #138 HMS Repulse

Remembering Force Z with a build of the HMS Repulse from the Tamiya 1:700 waterline series.

![Build](./assets/HMSRepulse_build.jpg?raw=true)

## Notes

[Force Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_Z), comprising battleship HMS Prince of Wales, battlecruiser HMS Repulse,
and destroyer escorts sailed from Singapore at 1710 on 8 December 1941 after receiving word of a Japanese convoy bound for Malaya.
On 10 December 1941 the force was intercepted by land-based bombers and torpedo bombers of the Imperial Japanese Navy,
and both the Prince of Wales and Repulse were sunk. Coming so soon after the attack on Pearl Harbor, it underscored the strategic shift from big gunned battleships to air power in naval warfare.

I've previously build the rest of Force Z that was engaged on the 10th Dec: HMS Prince of Wales, HMS Electra, HMS Express, HMAS Vampire.

In this build I am depicting HMS Repulse under attack by the first wave by elements of the IJN 22nd Koku Sentai, specifically
1st Squadron Mihoro Kokutai of 8 Mitsubishi Navy Type 96 G3M2 Nell bombers, each carrying two 250kg high explosive bombs.

### Force Z

[Force Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_Z) sailed from Singapore at 1710 on 8 December 1941 after receiving word of a Japanese convoy bound for Malaya.
It consisted of
the battleship [HMS Prince of Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Prince_of_Wales_(53)),
battlecruiser [HMS Repulse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Repulse_(1916)),
with destroyer escorts
[HMS Electra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Electra_(H27)),
[HMS Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Express_(H61)),
[HMAS Vampire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS_Vampire_(D68)) and
[HMS Tenedos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Tenedos_(H04)).

On 9 December 1941, Japanese submarine and reconnaissance aircraft reported on Force Z without their knowledge.
HMS Tenedos was also detached to return to Singapore as she was running low on fuel.
Overnight, flares dropped by Japanese aircraft alerted Force Z to their discovery.
Having lost the element of surprise, the force was ordered to return to Singapore.

On the return voyage, the force was intercepted by land-based bombers and torpedo bombers of the Imperial Japanese Navy.
Prince of Wales and Repulse were sunk by Japanese aircraft on 10 December 1941.
Destroyers Electra and Vampire moved in to rescue survivors of Repulse, while Express rescued those from the Prince of Wales.

Occurring just a few days after the Pearl Harbor attacks, this was Britain's turn to learn how vulnerable capital ships were to air power.
There was no attempt to alert or scramble RAF air cover for Force Z, though it is likely to have made little difference
as the number and vintage of the planes on hand were totally outclassed by the Japanese forces in play.

### Japanese Forces

Elements, 22nd Koku Sentai (Air Flotilla) - Rear-Admiral Matsunaga, based in Saigon

First Wave:

* 1st Squadron, Genzan Kokutai (Lt Ishihara): 9 Mitsubishi Navy Type 96 G3M2 'Nell' bombers, each carrying one Type 91 torpedo
* 2nd Squadron, Genzan Kokutai (Lt Takai): 7 Mitsubishi Navy Type 96 G3M2 'Nell' bombers, each carrying one Type 91 torpedo
* 1st Squadron, Mihoro Kokutai (Lt Shirai): 8 Mitsubishi Navy Type 96 G3M2 'Nell' bombers, each carrying two 250kg high explosive (HE) bombs
* 4th Squadron, Mihoro Kokutai (Lt Takahashi): 8 Mitsubishi Navy Type 96 G3M2 'Nell' bombers, each carrying one Type 91 torpedo

Second Wave:

* 2nd Squadron, Mihoro Kokutai (Lt Takeda): 8 Mitsubishi Navy Type 96 G3M2 'Nell' bombers, each carrying one 500kg HE bomb
* 3rd Squadron, Mihoro Kokutai (Lt Ohira): 9 Mitsubishi Navy Type 96 G3M2 'Nell' bombers, each carrying one 500kg HE bomb
* 1st Squadron, Kanoya Kokutai (Lt Nabeta): 9 Mitsubishi Navy Type 1 G4M1 'Betty' bombers, each carrying one Type 91 torpedo
* 2nd Squadron, Kanoya Kokutai (Lt Higashimori): 8 Mitsubishi Navy Type 1 G4M1 'Betty' bombers, each carrying one Type 91 torpedo
* 3rd Squadron, Kanoya Kokutai (Lt Iki): 9 Mitsubishi Navy Type 1 G4M1 'Betty' bombers, each carrying one Type 91 torpedo

#### First Wave

* 1113hrs. 1st Squadron, Mihoro Kokutai conducts high-level (3,000m) bombing attack on Repulse. Eight 250kg bombs dropped, but only one hit. Bomb penetrates hangar and causes minor damage
* 1149hrs. 2nd Squadron, Genzan Kokutai carries out a torpedo attack on Repulse. However, the battlecruiser evades all the torpedoes
* 1151hrs (approx). 4th Squadron, Mihoro Kokutai carries out a long-range torpedo attack on Repulse. As they were undetected by the British, they probably attacked from long range, immediately after the Genzan squadron completed its attack. None of these eight torpedoes hit their target
* 1157hrs. 1st Squadron, Mihoro Kokutai returns to carry out another high-level bombing attack on Repulse. All six 250kg HE bombs miss

#### Second Wave

* 1224hrs. The remainder of 1st and 2nd squadrons, Kanoya Kokutai break away from the attack on the Prince of Wales, and begin a run towards the Repulse, which is off their port side. They circle around the battlecruiser, to attack her from several directions at once
* 1224hrs. Repulse avoids most of these torpedoes. However, one hits Repulse on her port quarter, damaging her outer port propeller shaft and causing flooding
* 1225hrs. Simultaneously, the 3rd Squadron, Kanoya Kokutai have been approaching the battlecruiser from both port and starboard. Repulse struck by four more torpedoes, three on her port side and one to starboard. These cause extensive flooding damage, jam her rudder, and the battlecruiser begins to heel over and sink. The order is given to abandon ship
* 1230hrs. Attack by the Kanoya Kokutai ends as the aircraft head for their home bases
* 1232hrs. Repulse sinks

### The Kit

The
[Tamiya kit No. 31617](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/tamiya-31617-hms-repulse--105624)
is a in 1:700 waterline rendition of the HMS Repulse.
This is an old tooling from 1975 but it still stands up to scrutiny. Later boxings I think included the extra detail sprues.

#### Photo-etch Customization

While the Tamiya kit is a reasonably well detailed, I think it needs some PE to bring it to life, even if just for the railings.

I'm using a pretty good photo-etch set from
[White Ensign Models No. PE 780 1:700](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/white-ensign-models-pe-780-hms-repulse--105719).

Here are my notes on how the PE was applied:

### HMS Repulse's camouflage scheme during her final sortie with Force Z

On her final sortie with Force Z in December 1941, HMS Repulse wore a camouflage scheme designed to reduce visibility during operations in Southeast Asia. The details of her camouflage and deck color were as follows:

#### Camouflage Scheme

HMS Repulse carried an Admiralty disruptive camouflage pattern on her vertical surfaces. This pattern was typical for Royal Navy warships at the time and was meant to confuse enemy observers by breaking up the ship's outline.

The pattern was asymmetrical, featuring large, irregular patches of contrasting tones.
The colors likely included 507A (Dark Grey) and 507C (Light Grey) or similar shades used for disruptive designs. These were standard Royal Navy colors at the time.
The exact layout of the scheme on HMS Repulse varied across her hull and superstructure.

#### Deck Colors

The wooden decks of HMS Repulse were typically treated with Semtex, a non-slip material, or left in natural teak. However, for camouflage purposes:

The decks were often painted or stained a dark grey or similar muted color to reduce visibility from the air.
On her final sortie, her decks may have been painted in dark grey, consistent with contemporary Royal Navy practice.

#### Key Observations

Photographs and historical records suggest that the camouflage was primarily optimized for blending in with open ocean conditions rather than tropical or coastal environments. This was in keeping with the operational doctrine of Force Z, which was focused on engaging Japanese forces at sea rather than operating close to land.

### Nameplate

Modelled with TinkerCad, STL for printing available here:
[HMS_Repulse_Nameplate_2.stl](./assets/HMS_Repulse_Nameplate_2.stl)

I printed this on a PLA printer at the NLB Woodlands MakeIt centre (what a great resource!)

Primed with lashes of My Hobby Surfacer to fill some of those print lines. Painted with SM206 Super Chrome Silver 2 and SM205 Super Titanium 2
