## Notes

The [Battle of Tarawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tarawa) was fought on 20–23 November 1943 between the United States and Japan on Tarawa Atoll in the Gilbert Islands

Tarawa was the first time in the war that a United States amphibious landing was opposed by well entrenched, determined defenders.

Engaged on the ground was the
2nd Marine Division of the US Marine Corps
facing off against the Japanese defenders comprising the
3rd Special Base Defense Force and
7th Sasebo Special Naval Landing Force.

The battle was a costly on both sides. The Japanese were basically wiped out, almost to a man:
of the 3,636 Japanese in the garrison, only one officer and sixteen enlisted men survived.
Heavy casualties of over 25% on the US side sparked public protest, where headline reports of the high losses could not be understood for such a small and seemingly unimportant island.
