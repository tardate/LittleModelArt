## Notes

The
[85 mm divisional gun D-44](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/85_mm_divisional_gun_D-44)
was a Soviet divisional 85-mm calibre field artillery gun used in the last action of World War II. It was designed as the replacement for the 76 mm divisional gun M1942 (ZiS-3). The gun was no longer in front-line service with the Russian Ground Forces, until being pressed back into service by both sides in the Russo-Ukrainian War in 2023. Wartime service included use by communist forces during the Vietnam War and by Arab forces during their conflicts with Israel.

Russia has deployed D-44s in Ukraine. With one being destroyed by a Ukrainian drone on 27 September 2023 according to footage posted online. Other footage has shown a D-44 mounted on a tractor as a tank destroyer used by Ukraine in fighting near Kreminna.

### Build Log

It's a bit of a fiddly build.
I never quite figured out how to get the elevation adjustment right.

> A recent video posted by Ukraine’s military shows an MT-LB armored tractor of Ukraine’s 67th Mechanized Brigade with an old 85-millimeter D44 gun on top. Gunners hop up onto the vehicle’s roof to load and fire the World War II-era weapon. With each shot, a spent shell casing is ejected through the cut-out roof of the MT-LB and rolls back out its open rear access hatch.
