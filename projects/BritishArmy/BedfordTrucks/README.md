## Notes

The [Bedford QL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedford_QL) was a series of trucks manufactured by Bedford for use by the British Armed Forces in the Second World War.

* QLD: General service cargo truck and was the most numerous version in the series
* QLT: Troop carrier
    * From August 1941 and until the end of WW II more than 3,300 QLTs were produced.

With over 52,000 vehicles built between 1941 and 1945, the Bedford QL 3-ton truck was one of the most numerous British vehicles during the Second World War. Designed as either a general duties truck or troop transport, the QL was powered by a 3.5 litre, 6-cylinder petrol engine producing 72bhp, giving a governed top speed of 38mph.

Thanks to its high ground clearance, cross-country tyres and a 2-speed, 4-wheel-drive transfer box located in the centre of the chassis (giving 8 forward gear ratios), the QL had excellent cross country mobility. A large number are still in use by enthusiasts.

### The Kit

The Airfix kit No. A03306 is a 2010 tooling. It includes two vehicles (QLD, QLT) in 1:76 scale.
The most recent boxing is the 2025 release A03306A, now named "WWII 3-Ton G.S. And Troop Trucks".

Just the vehicles themselves right now. I haven't found suitable figures for the vehicles yet.
Hopefully these will end up in a diorama one day.
