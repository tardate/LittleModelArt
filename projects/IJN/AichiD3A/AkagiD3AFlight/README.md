## Notes

The [Aichi D3A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aichi_D3A) Navy designation "Type 99 Carrier Bomber"; Allied reporting name "Val" is a World War II carrier-borne dive bomber. It was the primary dive bomber of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) and was involved in almost all IJN actions, including the attack on Pearl Harbor.

The Aichi D3A  "Val" dive bomber was one of the most significant Japanese planes of the early war.
Surprisingly though, there are scant good options in 1:72 scale.
Wingsy Kits is working on a new 1:48 kit due in 2025, but I'm not aware of anything yet in 1:72.

I've long wanted to build the Aichi D3A in 1:72, and I got my hands on two contenders:

* [ZTS Plastyk No. S055](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/zts-plastyk-s055-type-99-aichi-d3-a1-val--1073616) - 2005 tooling
* [Airfix No. A02014V](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/airfix-a02014v-aichi-d3a1-val--1325491) - 1965 tooling

It didn't take me long to realise that neither of these kits are great. There are accuracy, detail and scaling issues with each. Fit and clear parts are also disappointing. As a result, I didn't stress too much about the build, and focused more on the presentation: both posed in a joint attack.

### Final Gallery

Akagi Attacks! A flight of Aichi D3A1 Val dive bombers unleashing destruction.

These are old kits from Airfix and ZTS Plastyk. For such a significant aircraft, I am surprised we don't have better options in 1:72.
Perhaps Wingsy Kits' new 1:48 tooling in 2025 will shake things up a bit!
