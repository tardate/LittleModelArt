## Notes

The Kure Naval District was established at Kure, Hiroshima in 1889, as the second of the naval districts responsible for the defense of the Japanese home islands. Along with the establishment of the navy base, a ship repair facility was also constructed.  The "Kure Shipyards" were officially renamed the
["Kure Naval Arsenal"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kure_Naval_Arsenal)
in 1903. Kure developed into one of the largest shipbuilding facilities in the Empire of Japan, capable of working with the largest vessels. The Arsenal included a major steel works.

### The Kit

This is one of the series of 1:3000 scale port dioramas that Fujimi have produced.

[![kit_box](./assets/kit_box.jpg)](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/fujimi-40131-kure-naval-port--993916)

Photo-etch detail sets are available from Fujimi for the
[gantries](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/fujimi-11503-ijn-kure-naval-port-gantry-crane-photo-etched-parts--1028650)
and
[cranes](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/fujimi-11496-ijn-naval-port-collection-common-photo-etched-parts--1019727).
I expect these would really improve the finesse of the final product, but I'm just going to build mine out of the box and try to represent the detail with paint effects.

The kit features 7 ship models:

* [Battleship Yamato ⼤和](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_battleship_Yamato)
* [Nagato-class Battleship 長門型戦艦](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagato-class_battleship)
* [Mogami-class Heavy Cruiser 最上型重巡](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mogami-class_cruiser)
* [Furutaka-class Heavy Cruiser 古鷹型](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furutaka-class_cruiser)
* [Takao-class Heavy Cruiser ⾼雄型](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takao-class_cruiser)
* 2 x [Kagerō-class destroyers 陽炎型駆逐艦](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kager%C5%8D-class_destroyer)
