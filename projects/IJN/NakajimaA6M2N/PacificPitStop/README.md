Building the old 1:144 ARII kit of the Nakajima A6M2-N, captured in a little diorama making a pit stop at an isolated Pacific island.

## Notes

I originally started this kit as part of a batch build with some 1:144 A6M2-N kits by Sweet, but in comparison the ARII (originally Crown) kit really showed up as different and simplified. As a result, I split it off into its own project, and probably had more fun for it.

There's something very satisfying about take a small, cheap kits and enjoying the process of turing it into a diorama over a few weeks.

### The Kit

[Nakajima Type 2 Fighter ARII No. 23030-200 1:144](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/arii-23030-200-nakajima-type-2-fighter--634675)
is a 1992 new boxing by ARII of the 1975 tool from Crown.
I purchased the kit for ¥620 from Leonardo LG2 in Sep-2023.

See [instructions](./assets/23030-200-instructions.pdf).

### Build Log

For such an old kit, it is quite a fine molding - simple but clean.

![build01a](./assets/build01a.jpg?raw=true)

the kit is simplified, but the lines are clean and true.

![build01b](./assets/build01b.jpg?raw=true)

![build01c](./assets/build01c.jpg?raw=true)

![build01d](./assets/build01d.jpg?raw=true)

![build01e](./assets/build01e.jpg?raw=true)

The kit unfortunately didn't come with decals for the tail,
and I don't have any good replacements so it remains blank.

### Base Construction

I decided to mount the plane of a small base representing a beach landing.

For the water, I used paper and multiple layers of painted gloss mod-podge.

![build02d](./assets/build02d.jpg?raw=true)

#### Trees

I used some trees I think I picked up from amazon.
They are a little over-scale, but the main issue was to overcome their "plastic-ness" with a thorough repaint.

#### Figures

I modified a
[1:150 figure from Yamada Kagaku](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/yamada-kagaku-3279-diorama-human-soldier--1690457)
to take the place of the pilot.

The ground crew come from the [Tomytec CN-NI118 Diorama Collection Sunbathers 1:150](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/tomytec-per-118-sunbathers--1365502).
