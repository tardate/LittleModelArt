## Notes

Late in the war, the F4F Wildcat was obsolete as a front line fighter compared to the faster F6F Hellcat and F4U Corsair,
however they were adequate for small escort carriers against submarine and shore threats.

At first, GM produced the FM-1, identical to the F4F-4, but reduced the number of guns to four, and added wing racks for two 250 lb (110 kg) bombs or six rockets. Production later switched to the improved FM-2 optimized for small-carrier operations, with a more powerful engine (the 1,350 hp (1,010 kW) Wright R-1820-56), and a taller tail to cope with the torque.

### The Kit

Sweet kit No. 14103 includes two 1:144 U.S. Navy Fighter GM FM-2 Wildcats.
The sprues even include the little cat mascot.

### Paint Scheme

I've chosen to depict scheme A/C#2 VC-80, CVE-61, USS Manila Bay.
It has tail code 11 under an inverted V.

USS Manila Bay (CVE-61) was a Casablanca-class escort carrier of the United States Navy.
Operations: Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign, Western New Guinea campaign, Battle off Samar, Battle of Mindoro, Invasion of Lingayen Gulf, Operation Magic Carpet

### Motor Control

I'm using a simple variable PWM motor controller based on a 555 timer.
It works fine with a 3V coin cell to drive the particular motor I am using.

PWM gives a much more realistic, slower speed drive than just direct drive from a coin cell.

Circuit designed with Fritzing, see [FM2.fzz](./FM2.fzz).
