## Using clear acrylic sheets to make a dam for a resin pour

To create a dam for a resin pour using clear acrylic sheets, follow these steps to ensure a smooth and effective setup:

Materials You’ll Need:

* Clear acrylic sheets (thickness around 1/8" to 1/4" works well)
* Measuring tape or ruler
* Utility knife or acrylic cutter
* Heat gun (optional for shaping the acrylic)
* Hot glue gun or silicone caulk (clear and waterproof)
* Clamps or heavy weights
* Level (to ensure your work surface is flat)
* Release agent (like wax or a mold release spray)

By using clear acrylic sheets, you can observe the resin as it cures and quickly detect any potential leaks, which makes it a practical option for creating clean resin pieces with a controlled pour area.

## Process

Measure and Cut the Acrylic Sheets:

* Measure the area around your resin piece to determine the height and length of each dam side.
* Cut the acrylic sheets with an acrylic cutter or utility knife. Score the acrylic several times along a straight edge, then apply pressure to break along the scored line.
* If your design has curved edges, you may need to use a heat gun to soften the acrylic slightly before bending.

Assemble the Dam:

* Place the acrylic sheets around the area where you’ll pour the resin. Make sure each sheet fits snugly with the neighboring sheet.
* Secure the joints between each sheet with hot glue or silicone caulk. Make sure there are no gaps where resin could leak through. Silicone caulk provides a strong, waterproof bond, but hot glue can also work for smaller projects.
* If possible, use clamps or weights to press the sheets together while the adhesive dries to create a secure, tight seal.

Seal the Base:

* Run a line of hot glue or silicone caulk around the base where the acrylic sheets meet the work surface to prevent resin from leaking out the bottom.
* Note: hot glue will fail if the resin generates too much heat. Either use a more secure fixative, or limit the resin pour to keep heat under control

Apply a Release Agent:

* Coat the inner side of the acrylic with a release agent like wax or mold release spray. This will make it easier to remove the acrylic once the resin has cured without risking damage to your piece.
* Note:
    * release agent is not absolutely necessary if using clean acrylic sheets
    * Silicone molds don't often strictly need a mold release. If you do use mold release, make sure to avoid silicone-based release agents, as silicone bonds to silicone and what you'll have is glue instead of a release agent. Ease-release 200 or 205 is great for silicone molds

Check the Level:

* Ensure your surface is completely level to prevent the resin from pooling on one side. Adjust as needed using a level and spacers.

Pour the Resin:

* Pour the resin within the dammed area. If using a deep pour, pour in layers according to the manufacturer’s instructions to prevent overheating and cracking.
* Note: Put the project in an aluminium foil containers (e.g. BBQ tray) for the pour. They are excellent for containing a resin pour, and stopping disasters from leaking all over the work-bench!

Cure and Remove:

* Once the resin has cured fully, gently remove the acrylic sheets by pulling or prying them away from the resin, aided by the release agent you applied.
