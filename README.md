# 154 Little Model Art Projects

> Latest addition :sparkles: [IJN Matsu-class Destroyer Sakura](./projects/IJN/Sakura) - Building the Matsu-class Destroyer Sakura (æ¡œ) from Fujimi in 1:700 scale with a few upgrades (replaced some of the equipment with better moldings, fixed the stern profile).

Just my personal collection of scale modelling, miniatures, and art projects.

Some of these were originally featured in the LittleArduinoProjects repository, but I have since split these into separate collections.
See [LittleArduinoProjects](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects) if you are looking for the electronics projects!

## The Project Index

The best way to browse the projects is to take a look at the
[Catalog](https://modelart.tardate.com/).
It's actually a static web site generated directly from the repository. Try it out:
