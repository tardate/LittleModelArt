# 162 Little Model Art Projects

> Latest addition :sparkles: [Kawanishi N1K2-J Prototype](./projects/IJN/KawanishiN1K/N1K2J) - The Kawanishi N1K2-J Prototype flying over Yokosuka 1944. This is the Platz PDR-2 kit in 1:144 with a pilot improvised from a Yamada Kagaku figure.

Just my personal collection of scale modelling, miniatures, and art projects.

Some of these were originally featured in the LittleArduinoProjects repository, but I have since split these into separate collections.
See [LittleArduinoProjects](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects) if you are looking for the electronics projects!

## The Project Index

The best way to browse the projects is to take a look at the
[Catalog](https://modelart.tardate.com/).
It's actually a static web site generated directly from the repository. Try it out:
