# 129 Little Model Art Projects

> Latest addition:sparkles: [Kyushu J7W1](./projects/IJN/Kyushu/J7W1) - Building the Kyūshū J7W Shinden 震電, as used by Kōichi Shikishima in Godzilla Minus One to deliver the final fatal blow. No electronics in this one.

Just my personal collection of scale modelling, miniatures, and art projects.

Some of these were originally featured in the LittleArduinoProjects repository, but I have since split these into separate collections.
See [LittleArduinoProjects](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects) if you are looking for the electronics projects!

## The Project Index

The best way to browse the projects is to take a look at the
[Catalog](https://modelart.tardate.com/).
It's actually a static web site generated directly from the repository. Try it out:
