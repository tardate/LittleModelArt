# 132 Little Model Art Projects

> Latest addition:sparkles: [Fokker Dr.I](./projects/Germany/Fokker/DR1) - Building the Fokker Dr.I (intended for another diorama). This is the venerable Airfix Vintage Classic from 1957!

Just my personal collection of scale modelling, miniatures, and art projects.

Some of these were originally featured in the LittleArduinoProjects repository, but I have since split these into separate collections.
See [LittleArduinoProjects](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects) if you are looking for the electronics projects!

## The Project Index

The best way to browse the projects is to take a look at the
[Catalog](https://modelart.tardate.com/).
It's actually a static web site generated directly from the repository. Try it out:
