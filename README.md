# 140 Little Model Art Projects

> Latest addition:sparkles: [Luella Bates and the FWD Model B](./projects/USA/LuellaBates) - Celebrating the life of Luella Bates, one of the first women to professionally drive and test heavy-duty trucks, paving the way for future generations in transportation and heavy industry. Features the Roden FWD Model B in 1:72.

Just my personal collection of scale modelling, miniatures, and art projects.

Some of these were originally featured in the LittleArduinoProjects repository, but I have since split these into separate collections.
See [LittleArduinoProjects](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects) if you are looking for the electronics projects!

## The Project Index

The best way to browse the projects is to take a look at the
[Catalog](https://modelart.tardate.com/).
It's actually a static web site generated directly from the repository. Try it out:
