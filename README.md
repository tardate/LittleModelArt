# 152 Little Model Art Projects

> Latest addition :sparkles: [Soviet 85mm D-44 Divisional Gun](./projects/Soviet/D44) - The D-44 was introduced late in WWII and has been put into service by many countries in wars since then, up to and including both sides in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This build is intended for a future diorama.

Just my personal collection of scale modelling, miniatures, and art projects.

Some of these were originally featured in the LittleArduinoProjects repository, but I have since split these into separate collections.
See [LittleArduinoProjects](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects) if you are looking for the electronics projects!

## The Project Index

The best way to browse the projects is to take a look at the
[Catalog](https://modelart.tardate.com/).
It's actually a static web site generated directly from the repository. Try it out:
