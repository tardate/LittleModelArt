# 160 Little Model Art Projects

> Latest addition :sparkles: [Gloster Javelin FAW.9R](./projects/RAF/Gloster/Javelin) - Building the Airfix 1:48 Gloster Javelin FAW.9R (XH893) transferred to 64 Squadron in 1965 and based at RAF Tengah

Just my personal collection of scale modelling, miniatures, and art projects.

Some of these were originally featured in the LittleArduinoProjects repository, but I have since split these into separate collections.
See [LittleArduinoProjects](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects) if you are looking for the electronics projects!

## The Project Index

The best way to browse the projects is to take a look at the
[Catalog](https://modelart.tardate.com/).
It's actually a static web site generated directly from the repository. Try it out:
