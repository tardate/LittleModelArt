# 161 Little Model Art Projects

> Latest addition :sparkles: [BOAC Boeing 314A Clipper](./projects/UK/BOAC-Boeing-314A-Clipper) - Building the Airfix 1:144 Vintage Classic kit of the Boeing 314 Clipper, in the livery of BOAC 1941.

Just my personal collection of scale modelling, miniatures, and art projects.

Some of these were originally featured in the LittleArduinoProjects repository, but I have since split these into separate collections.
See [LittleArduinoProjects](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects) if you are looking for the electronics projects!

## The Project Index

The best way to browse the projects is to take a look at the
[Catalog](https://modelart.tardate.com/).
It's actually a static web site generated directly from the repository. Try it out:
