# 155 Little Model Art Projects

> Latest addition :sparkles: [Fairey Flycatcher](./projects/RoyalNavy/Fairey/Flycatcher) - Building the Fairey Flycatcher stationed at HMS Hermes, China Station, 1930. This is the Armory Models Group kit in 1:48, with a hand carved prop and wood decals from Proper Plane of Ukraine. All upstaged by a couple of cheeky seagulls.

Just my personal collection of scale modelling, miniatures, and art projects.

Some of these were originally featured in the LittleArduinoProjects repository, but I have since split these into separate collections.
See [LittleArduinoProjects](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects) if you are looking for the electronics projects!

## The Project Index

The best way to browse the projects is to take a look at the
[Catalog](https://modelart.tardate.com/).
It's actually a static web site generated directly from the repository. Try it out:
