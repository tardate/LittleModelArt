# 134 Little Model Art Projects

> Latest addition:sparkles: [Squadron Commander Lord Flasheart](./projects/RAF/LordFlasheart) - Woof! The legend of Squadron Leader The Lord Flasheart. An Elan13 Miniatures bust with a Fokker Dr.1 from Airfix.

Just my personal collection of scale modelling, miniatures, and art projects.

Some of these were originally featured in the LittleArduinoProjects repository, but I have since split these into separate collections.
See [LittleArduinoProjects](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects) if you are looking for the electronics projects!

## The Project Index

The best way to browse the projects is to take a look at the
[Catalog](https://modelart.tardate.com/).
It's actually a static web site generated directly from the repository. Try it out:
