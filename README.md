# 131 Little Model Art Projects

> Latest addition:sparkles: [Foxtrot-class Zaporizhzhia](./projects/Ukraine/Zaporizhzhia) - MikroMir have made a very good kit of the Foxtrot-class Zaporizhzhia. The build went well, but my attempt to encase it in resin was a catastrophic failureâ˜¹ One day I'll try this again, but in the spirit of sharing failures as well as successes: here's the gory story of what went wrong!

Just my personal collection of scale modelling, miniatures, and art projects.

Some of these were originally featured in the LittleArduinoProjects repository, but I have since split these into separate collections.
See [LittleArduinoProjects](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects) if you are looking for the electronics projects!

## The Project Index

The best way to browse the projects is to take a look at the
