# 150 Little Model Art Projects

> Latest addition :sparkles: [Yokosuka D4Y2 Suisei](./projects/IJN/YokosukaD4Y/D4Y2) - Building the Micro Ace 1:72 boxing of the Yokosuka D4Y2 Suisei Model 12 (彗星一二型)

Just my personal collection of scale modelling, miniatures, and art projects.

Some of these were originally featured in the LittleArduinoProjects repository, but I have since split these into separate collections.
See [LittleArduinoProjects](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects) if you are looking for the electronics projects!

## The Project Index

The best way to browse the projects is to take a look at the
[Catalog](https://modelart.tardate.com/).
It's actually a static web site generated directly from the repository. Try it out:
