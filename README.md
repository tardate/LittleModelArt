# 149 Little Model Art Projects

> Latest addition :sparkles: [Leopard 2A6 Armed Forces of Ukraine](./projects/Ukraine/Leopard2A6) - Building the ICM 1:72 model of the Leopard 2A6 deployed with the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Just my personal collection of scale modelling, miniatures, and art projects.

Some of these were originally featured in the LittleArduinoProjects repository, but I have since split these into separate collections.
See [LittleArduinoProjects](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects) if you are looking for the electronics projects!

## The Project Index

The best way to browse the projects is to take a look at the
[Catalog](https://modelart.tardate.com/).
It's actually a static web site generated directly from the repository. Try it out:
